E EWES , by the Grace of God, King of France and of 
Navarre , to all Prefent and to come, Greeting. King 
Henry the Great, Our Grandfather of Glorious Memory, 
defiring to prevent, that the Peace which he had procured 
for his Subjects, after the great Lodes they had fuftained, by the long 
continuance of Civil and Forrcign Wars, might not be difturbed by 
occalion of the pretended Reformed Religion, as it had been during 
the Reign of the Kings his Predeceffors, had by his Edid given at 
Nantes in the Month of April, .if'98. Regulated the Condud which 
was to’bc obferved with Refpcd to thofe of the laid Religion, the 
places where they might publiekly exercife the fame, appointed ex- 
traordinary Judges, to adminiftcr Juftice to them 5 and laftly, alfo by 
foveral diftind Articles provided for every thing, which he judged 
needful for the maintenance of Peace and Tranquility in his Kingdom 
and to dimini (h the Averfion which was between thofe of the one and 
other Religion ; and this, to the end that he might be in a better 
condition for the taking fome effedual courfe (which he was refcl- 
ved to do) to reunite thofe again to the Church, who upon fo flight 
occafions had withdrawn themfelves from it. And forafmucn as this 
Intention of the King, our faid Grandfather, could not be effeded, 
by reafon of his fuddain and precipitated Death \ and that the Exe- 
cution of the forefaid Edid was Interrupted during the Minority of 
the late King, Our ipoft Honoured Lord and Father, of Glorious Me- 
mory by teafbn of dome new Enterprifes of thofe of the Pretended 
Reformed Religion, whereby they gave occafion for their being de- 
prived of fcveral advantages which had been granted to them, by 
the forefaid Edid: Notwithftanding, the King, Our faid late Lord 
and Father, according to his wonted Clemency, granted them ano*> 
ther Edid at Nifmes , in. the Month of July 1629, by means of which 
the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom being, now again re- eftabli filed, 
the faid late King, being animated with the fame Spirit and Zeal for 
Religion, as the -King Our faid Grandfather was, refolved to make 

■ & 'a 


fi£>od ufc of this Tranquility, by endeavouring to put this pious de- 
lign in Execution, but Wars abroad, coming on a few years after, f® 
that from the Year 163 5*, to the Truce which was concluded with 
the Princes of Europe, 10-1-684.. The Kingdom having becmonly for 
feme fhort Intervals altogether free from troubles, it was not poflible 
to. do any other thing for the advantage of Religion, lave only to di- 
minifh the number of places permitted for the Exercife of the preten- 
ded Reformed Religion,- as well by the Interdiction of thofe which 
were found ereCtcd, in prejudice to the difpofal made in the laid 
EdiCt,- as by fupprefTing the mix’d Chambers of Judicature, whichwer 
compofed of an equal number of Papifts- and Protcftants, the erect- 
ing of which was- only done byProvifion, and to ferve the prefen ^ 
Exigency* 

Whereas therefore at length it hath jpleafed God to grant, that Our* 
Subjects enjoying a perfect Peace, and We Our felves being no longer 
taken up with the cares of protecting them again ft oiu Enemies, arc 
now in a condition to make good ufe of the faid Truce, which wc 
have on purpofe facilitated, in order to the applying our felves en- 
tirely in the fearching out of means, which .might fuccefsfully effetft 
and aecomplifh the defign of the Kings, our faid Grand-father and; 
Father, and which alfo hath been our Intention ever fince We came to 
the Grown j we fee at prefent ( not -without a juft acknowledgment 
of what we owe to God on that account^ that our endeavours have? 
attained the end we propos’d to Our felves, . forasmuch as the greater, 
and better part of Our Subjects of the faid Pretended Reformed Re- 
ligion have already embraced the Catholick , and fince by means 
thereof, the Execution of the EdiCt of Nantes, and of ail other Ordi-? 
nance*, in favour of the faid Pretended Reformed Religion, is made 
ufelefs, we judge that we can do nothing better towards the entire 
effacing of the memory of thofe Troubles, Confufion and Mifchief,' 
which the Progrefs of that falfe Religion, hath been the caufe of in 
Our Kingdom, and which have given occafion to. the faid EdiCt, and 
to-fo many other Edicts and Declarations which went before it, or 
were made fince with reference thereto, than by a Total Revocation 
of the faid EdiCt of Nantes , and the particular Articles and Conccffi- 
ops granted therein, and whatfoever elfe hath been EnaCtcd fipce 
fci- favour of the faid Religion,.

The 



A Jhort Account of the Violent Proceedings , 
and unheard of Cruelties, which have hen 
: Exe rcifed upon thofe of Montauban, 
and which continue to be put in Practife 
in other places againft thofe of the Re- 
formed Religion in France, for to make 
them Renounce their Religion. 

C w N Saturday the , 8 S of Augufl 1685'. the Intendant of the 
\ Upper Guienne , who Refides at Montauban, having 
S Summoned the Principal Protepants of the faid City 
r ’ to come before him , reprcfenting unto them , that 
they could not be Ignorant that the abfolute Will and 
Pleafure of the King was, to Tolerate but one Religion in his King* 
dom, viz,, the Roman Catholic^ Religion, and therefore wifhed them 
readily to comply with the fame, and in order thereto, advifed theni 
to Aflfemble themfelves and confider what Refolution they would take. 
To this Propofal fome anfwered, That there was no need of their Af- 
fembhng themfelves upon that Account, for af much as every one of them 
in particular, were to Try and Examine themfelves , and be always in 
a readinefs to give a reafon of the Faith which was in them. 

The next day the Intendant again Commanded them to meet to* 
gether in the Town-Houfe, which fhould be left free for them from 
Noon till Six of the Clook in the Evening, where Meeting accor^ 
dingly, they Unanimoufly refolded, as they had Lived, fo to perfift 
till Death in their Religion ; which Refolution of theirs, there were 
fome Deputed by them to declare to the Intend ar*t j who prefenting 
themfelves before him, he who was appointed Spokefman, began to 
Addrefs himfelf to the Intendant in theft Words: My Lord , We 
are not unacquainted how we are menaced with the greatep Violence* 
Hold there, faid the Intendant (interrupting hiffij No Violence. After 
this the Protepant continued j Bat Whatever Force or Violence may be 
put upon us Here the Intendant interrupting him again, faid, /

( 1 ) 

forbid you Jo ufe any fuch Words : Upon which fecond Interruption, he 
contented himfelf to allure him in few words, That they were all Re- 
folved to Live and Dye in their Religion. 

The day after the Battaliion of La Fere confiding of 1 6 Companies, 
entred the City, and were followed by many more. The Protejiants 
all this while Dreaming of no other Defign they had againft them, 
but that of Ruining their Eftates and Impoverifhing them, had at 
ready taken fome Meafures how to bear the faid Tfyal ; they had 
made a Common Purle for the Relief of fuch who fhould be moft 
Burthen’d with Quartering, and were come to a Refolution to poflefs 
what they had in common : But alafs, how far thefe poor Souls were 
miftaken in their Accounts , and how different the Treatment they 
received from the Dragoons was, from what they had expedted, I {hall 
now Relate, to you. 

Firft therefore, in order to their Executing the Defign and Projedt 
they had formed agphft them, they made the Souldiers take up their 
Quarters in one certain place of the City, but withal appointed feve- 
til Corf de Cards to cut off the Communication which one part of the 
City might have with the other, andpofiefs’d themfelves of the Gates, 
that none, might make their Efcape. Things being thus ordered, the 
TroOpers, Souldiers and, Dragoons began to Pradtife all manner of 
Hoftilities and Cruelties wherewith the Devil can Infpire the moft In- 
humane and Reprobate Minds : They marr’d and defac’d their HouC 
holdftuff, broke their Looking- Glafies, and other like Utenfils and 
Ornaments, they let the Wine run about their Cellars, caft abroad and 
fpoil’d their Corn, and other Alimentary Provifions : and as for thofe 
things which they could not break and dafti'to piec.es>. as the Furni- 
ture of Beds, Hangings, Tapiftry, Linnen, Wearing Apparrel,Plate, and 
thihgs of the like Nature, thefe they carried to the Market place, 
where the Jefuits bought them of the Souldiers, and encouraged the 
Roman Catholickj to do the like. They did not ftick to Sell the very 
Houfes of fuch who were moft Refolute and Conftant in their ?ro-. 
fdTi.on It is fuppofed according to a Moderate Calculation, that in 
»ur or five days, the Protect ants of that City were the 
Poorer by a Million of Money, than they were before the entring of 
thefe Milfionaries. There were Souldiers who demanded 400 Crowns 
a piece of their Hofts for fpending Money, and many Preteftants were 
forced to pay down Ten Piftols to each Souldier upon the fame 
account 

• In 


Vj. 


• In the mean time the outrages they committed upon their Per fons 
were moft deteftable and Barbarous, I fhall only here fet down fome 
few o-f which I have been particularly Inform’d. A certain Taylor 
called Bearnois was bound and drag’d by the Souldiers to the Corp de 
Gard } where they Boxed and Buffettedhim all Night, all which blows 
and Indignities he fuffered with the greateft conftancy Imaginable, 
The Troopers who Quartered with Mounfieur Solignac made his Di- 
ning Room a Stable for their Horfes, tho the Furniture of it was Va- 
lued at ioooo Livers, and forc’d him to turn the Broach till his Arm 
was near Burnt, by their continual calling of Wood upon the Fire, 
A Paffenger as he went through the laid City faw fome Souldiers. 
beating a Poor Man even to Death, for to force him to go to Mafs, 
whilft the conftant Martyr to his iaft Breath, cryed, He would never 
do it , and only requefted they would Dispatch and make an end of him . 
The Barons of Cauffads and De la Motte\ whofe Conftancy and Piety 
might haye Infpired Courage and Refolution to the reft of the Citizens, 
were lent away to Cahors. Mounfieur £>’ Allies one of the prime 
Gentlemen of Montauban ,. being a Venerable Old Man, found fp ill 
Treatment at their. hands, as its thought he will fcarcely efcape with 
Life. Mounfieur De Garrifon who was one of the moft confiderable 
Men of that City, and an intimate Friend of the Intendant, went 
and call; himfelf at his Feet, imploring his Protection, and conjuring 
him to rid him of the Souldiers, that he might have no force put upon 
his Confcience, adding, that in Recompence of this Favour, he beg’d 
of him, He would willingly give him all be had, which was to the Va- 
lue of about a Million of Livers ; but by all his Entreaties and Proffers 
he could not in the leaft prevail with the Intendant, who gave order, 
that for a Terror to the meaner fort, he fhould be worfe tiled than the 

reft, by dragging him along the Streets. 

The Method they moft commonly made tile of, for to make them 
abjure their Religion , and which -could not be the ProduCl of any 
thing but Hell, was this ; Some of the moft ftrong and vigorous Soul- 
diers, took their Hofts or other Perfons of the Houfe,and walk’d them up 
and down in fome Chamber, continually tickling them and tolling them 
like a Ball from one to another, without giving them the leaft Inter- 
million and keeping them in this condition for three days and nights 
together, without Meat, Drink or Sleep 5 when they were, fb weaned 
and fainting, that they could no longer ftand upon their Legs, they 
laid them on a Bed, cohtinuing as before to Tickle and Torment themy 

' B z • , , "‘after 


after feme time when they thought them fomewhat recovered, they 
made them rife, and walked them up and down as before, fome- 
times tickling, and other times Ladling them with Rods, to keep 
them from Sleeping. As foon as one Party of thefe Barbarous Tor- 
menters were Tyred and wearied out, they were Relieved by others 
of their Companions, who coming frefh to the Work, with greater 
Vigour and Violence reiterated the fame Courfe. By this Infernal 
Invention (which they had formerly made ufe of wkh fuccefs, in 
Bearn and other places ) many went Diftrafted,. and others became 
Mopifh and Stupid, and remain (o, 

Thofe who made their Elcape were fain to abandon their Eftates, 
yea, their Wives, Children, and Aged Relations to the Mercy of thefe 
Barbarous and more then Savage Troops The fame Cruelties were 
Aiftcd at Negrephjfe, a City near to Montauhan, where thefe Bloody 
Emiffaries committed unpara-Uel’d Outrages, Ifaac Favin, a Citizen 
of that place was hung up by his Arm- pits, and Tormented a whole 
Night by Pinching and Tearing of hisFlefii with Pincers, tho by all 
this they were not able to (hake his Conftancy in the leaft. The Wife 
of One Rouffion a Joyner, being violently drag’d by the Souldiers along 
the Streets, , for to force her to hear Mafs, Dyed of this Cruel and In- 
humane Treatment, as foon as (he reach’d the Church Porch. 

Amongft, other their Devilifh Inventions this was one, they made a 
great Fire round about a Boy of about Ten Years of Age, who con- 
tinually with Hands and Eyes lifted to Heaven, cryed, My God help 
me, and when they faw the Lad refolved to Dye (b, rather than Re- 
nounce his Religion, they (hatch’d him from the Fire, when he was 
at the very point of being Burnt. The Cities of Cauffade, Realville , 
St. Anthonin , and other Towns and places in the Upper Guieme , met 
with the fame Entertainment, as well as Bergerac, and many other 
places of Perigord, and of the Lower Gniennc, which had a like Chare 
of thefe Cruel and Inhumane Ufages. 

The fo rementioned Troops marched at lad to Cafires , to commit 
the fame Infolencies and Barbarities there alfo j and it. is not to be 
doubted, but that tKey will continue and carry on the fame courfe of 
Cruelties, where ever they go, if Godwin Pity and Companion toiris 
People do not reftrain them. 

It is to be feared (for it.feems but too probablej that this dreadful 
Perfecutiow in conjunction with thofe Artifices the Papifts make ufe 
of to Difguife their Religion, and to f ' perfwade Proteftants that they 

tell; 


fliall be differed to Worfhip God as formerly, will make many to 
comply with them, or at leaft make their Mouths give their Hearts 
the Lye, in hopes of being by this means put into a condition to make 
their efcapes , and returning to that Profeffion, which their weak- 
nefs hath made them deny. 

But alas! this is not all, for thofe poor Wretches, whom by thefe 
Devilifh ways of theirs, they have made to Blafpheme and Abjure 
their Religion, as if this were not enough, muft now become the Per- 
fecutors and Tormentors of their own Wives and Children, for to ob- 
lige and force them to Renounce alfo, for they are threatned, that 
if within three days time they do not make their whole Family Re- 
cant in like manner, thofe rough Apoftles ( the Dragoons ) (hall be 
fain to take further pains with them. in order to perfect their Con- 
verfion. And who after all this can have the leaft doubt but that 
thefe unhappy Dragoons are the very EmilTarics of Hell,, whofe very 
laft Efforts and Death-ftruglings thefe fcem to be? 

This Relation hath given a fhprt view offome of thofe Sufferings) 
the Reformed have undergone, but not of all : It is certain that- in 
clivers places they have try ed to wear out their Patience, and over- 
come their Conftancy by applying Red-hot Irons to the Hands and 
Feet of Men, and to the Paps of Women. At Nantes they' hung up 
feveral Women and Maids by their Feet, and others by their Arm- 
pits, and that Stark-Naked, thus expofing them to Publick View, 
which afliiredly is the moft cruel and exquifite Suffering can befall 
that Sex, becaufe in this cafe their Shamefacednefs and Modefty is 
moft fenfibly touched, which is the moft tender part of their Soul. 
They have bound Mothers that gave Suck unto Polls, and let their 
little Infants lye Languishing in their fight without being fufferCd 
to Suckle them for feveral days, and all this while left them crying* 
moaning, and galping for Life, and even Dying for Hunger and Thirl!, 
that by this means they might Vanquifh the Conftancy of their Ten- 
derdiearted Mothers, Swearing to them they would never permit 
they fhould give them Suck till they promifed to Renounce their Pro- 
feffion of the Gofpel. They have taken Children of Four or Five 
Years of Age y . and. kept them from Meat and Drink for fome time, 
and when they have .been ready to faint away and' give the Ghoft,

continually Relieve one another for to Drag, Beat, Torment and Toft 
tip and' do'w'nfth'efe Miftrdble Wretches withdbt Mermiffion. If it 
happen that any by their Patience and Conftancy do ftand it out, and 
Triumph over all the Rage and Fury of thofe Dragoons, they go to 
their Commander and acquaint him they have done all they could,

But fome it may be will objeft, you make a great rjoffe about 
a fmall matter, all Froteftartts have-not beeh expcffed to theft Cruelties 
but- only feme few obftinate Perfons : Well, I will fllppofe 1b, but 
yet the Horor of thofe Torments Inffi&fed on’ fome, hath fo fill’d thl 
Imagination of thefe Miferabie Wretches, that the very thoughts of 
them hath made them comply ; it is indeed a Weakneft of which we 
are afhamed for their fakes, and from Whence we hope God will 
raife them again, in his due timet yet; thus much .we may alledge 
for their excufe, that never was any Perfecution upon pretence of 
Religion carried on to that pitch, and with that Politick Malice and 
Cm city that this hath been , and therefore of aii thofe which ever 
the -Church of Oirift groan’d under, none can be compar’d with it. 
True indeed it is that in former Ages it hath been common to Burn 
'the Faithful nnder the Naftie-of : 2£enetit?jQi* , hxit how few were there 
expofed to that cruel kind of Death, in -companion of thofe who 
elcaped the Executioners hands ? but behold here a great People at 
once opprefs’d, deftroy’d, and ruin’d by a vaft Army of Prodigious 
Butchers, and few or none eftaping. Former, yea late times have 
given us fome Inftances of Maffacres, but thefe were only violent 
Tempefts, and fuddain Hurricanes, which lafted but a Night, or at 
theuiofi: a few days, and they who flittered in them were foon Out of 
their pains., and the far greater number cfcaped the dint of them : 
but how much more dreadful is the p:;efcnt condition of the Prote- 
flants in France ? -And to -the end we may take a true view and right

meafures of it, let u$ confider, that nothing can be conceived more 
terrible than a ftate of War , but what War to be compared with- 
this ? They fee a whole. Army of Butcherly Caoibals entring their 
Houfes, Battering, Breaking, Burning and Deftroying whatever cornea 
to hand, Swearing, Curfmg,. and Blafpheming like Devils, beating to 
excefs, offering all manner of Indignities and Violence, diverting 
themfeives, and ftriving to outvie each other in Inventing New Me- 
thods of Pain and Torment, not to be appeafed with Money or good 
chear, Foaming and Roaring like Ravenous Raging Lyons, and pre- 
fenting Death, at every Moment, and that which is worfe than all 
this, driving People to Diftradion, and feifelefs Stupidity by thofe 
Devilifh Inventions, we have given you an Inftance of in the Relati- 
on of Mont attb an. 

Moreover, this Perfecution hath one Charadteriftical note more, 


which, without any Exaggeration, will give it the Precedence in Hiftory 
for Cruelty, above all thofe which the Church of God ever fuffered 
under Nero, Maxyminm, or Diode fian, which is the fevere Prohibition 
of departing the Kingdom upon pain of Confifcation of Goods, of 
die Gaily, of the Lafh, and perpetual Imprifonment. All the Sea 
Ports are kept with that exadnefs, as if it were to hinder the efcape 
of Tray tors and common Enemies-; All the ; Prifons of Sea Port 
Towns are eram’d with thefe miferable Fugitives, Men, Women, 
Boys and Girls, who there are Condemn’d to the worft of Punifft- 
ments, for having had a defire to fave themfeives, from this dread- 
ful Perfecution and deluging Calamity ; this is the thing which is 
unparallel’d, and of which we find no Inftance, This i-s that Super- 
lative cxcefs of Cruelty, which we fhall not find in the Lift of all the 
violent and Bloody Proceedings of the Duke of he Maftacred^ 
he Beheaded, he Butchered, but at leaft he did not Prohibit thofe 
that could, to make their Efcape. In the laft Hungarian Perfecution, 
nothing was required of the Proteftants, but only that their Minifters 
fhould Bariifli themfeives, and Abandon and Renounce the conduct 
of their Flocks ; and becaufe they were unwilling to obey thefe or- 
ders, therefore it is they have groaned under fo long, and fo terrible a 
Perfecution, as they have done ; Blit this Hungarian Perfecutkai isnot 
to be compared with- that we are Speaking of, for the Fury of that 
Tempeft difeharged it felf upon the Minifters only, no Armies were 
Imploy’d to force the People to change their Religion, by a thoufand

A Letter fent from Bordeaux giving an Account of 
the Ferfecntion of thofe of the Proteftant 
Religion in France. 




W Hatfoever you have heard concerning the Perfecutios of thofe 
that are of our Religion in the Land of Beam, Guienne, and 
Terigort , is but too true, and lean affine you, that they who have 
given you that account, have been fo far fromamplifying the matter.

that they have only acquainted you with fome few particulars 5 yet 
am I not much furprifed at the' difficulty you find to pcrfwade your 
felf that the things of which your Friends Inform you are true j in 
cafes of this Nature, fo amazingly unexpected, we are apt often to 
diftruft our own Eyes 5 and I profefs to you, that though all places 
round about us Eccho the Report of our Ruine and Deftrudion, yet 
I can fcarcely perfwade my felf it is fo indeed, becaufe I cannot com- 
prehend it. It is no matter of furprife or amazement to fee the 
Church of Chrift afflicted upon Earth, forafmueh as jfhe is a ftranger 
here, as well as her Captain, Lord and Husband, the Holy and Ever- 
bleffed Jefus was, and muft like him, by the fame way of Crofs and 
Suffering, return to her own Country, which is above. It is no mat- 
ter of Aftonifhment to find her from time to time buffering the worft 
of ufage, and moft cruel Perfecutions 5 all Ages have feen her expo- 
fed to fuch Try als as thefe, which are fo neccffaiy for theTeftingof 
her Faith, and fo fit a matter of her Future Glory. Neither is it any 
great wonder, if, amidft thefe fore Tryals, vaft numbers of thofe who 
made Profeflion of the Gofpel, do now renounce and forfake it : We 
know that all have not Faith, and it is more than probable that they 
who do not follow Chrift, but becaufe they Thrive by it, and for the 
Loaves will ceafe to be of his Retinue, when he is about to oblige 
them to bear his Crofs, and deny themfelves. But that which feems 
Inconceivable to me, is, that jjour Enemies fhould pitch upon fuch 
ftrange ways and methods, to deftroy us, as they have done, and that 
in fo doing, they fhould meet with a fuccefs fo Prodigious and doleful. 
I fhall as briefly as I can endeavour to give you an account of fo much 
as I have underftood of it. 

All thofe thundring -Declarations, and deftrudive Arrefts , which 
'continually were Sued for, and obtain’d againft us, and which were 
‘Executed with the extremity of Rigour, were fcarce able to move 
any one of us. The forbidding of our Publick Exercifes, the demo- 
tifhing of our Churches, and the fevere Injundion that not fo much 
as two or three of us fhould dare to Affemble in order to any thing of 
Divine Worfhip, had no other effed upon the far greater part of us, 
than to Inflame our Zeal, inftead of abating it, obliging us to Pray 
to God with greater fervor and Devotion in our Clofets , and to 
Meditate of his Word with greater Application and Attention. And 
neither the great wants, to which we 'were reduced by being depriv’d 
of our Offices and Imploys, and all other means of Living, and by 

C thofe 


oo 

■thole 'nfupportable charges with which they Prove to over- whelm us,., 
as well by Taxes, as the Quartering of Souldiers (both which were as 
heavy as could be laid upon us ) nor the continual trouble we were, 
put toby Criminal or other matters of Law, which at the Suit of 
one or other were ftill laid to our charge, tho upon the moft frivo- 
lous and unjuft: pretences imaginable j I fay aft thefe were not. 
able to wear out our Patience, which was hardned againfi: all Cala- 
mities ; infomuch as the defign of forcing us to abandon the Truth of. 
the Gofpel, would Infallibly have been Ship-wrack’d, if no other 
means had been taken in hand for this purpofe. But alas! our Ene- 
mies were too Ingenious to be bauk’d fo, and had taken our Ruine too,,* 
much to Heart, not to Study for means effedtual and- proper to bring 
about their defires j They call’d to mind what 'Prodigious fuccefs, a. 
new kind of Perfecution had had of late Years in Voi8ott> Amix , and 
Xaintonge , which the Intendants of thofe places had bethought them- 
lelves of, and they made no difficulty to have Recourfe to the fame,, 
as to a mean's Infallible, and not to be doubted odd 

I muft tell you, Sir , That we had not the leaft thought that ever 
filch violent Methods as thefe would have been pitched upon, as the 
means of our Converfion: We were always of Opinion, that none 
but Dennuieux’s and Mar iliac s could be fit Inftmments for fuch like. 
Enterprifes; neither could we ever have Imagin’d that Generals of 
Armies, who account it a Shame and Reproach to Attack and take 
feme paul-tryTown or Village, fhouldever debafe themfelves toBe- 
fiege Old Men, Women, and Children in their own Hotifes; or that 
ever Souldiers, wlio think themfelves ennobled by their Swords, ffiould 
degrade themfelves fbfarto take up the Trade of Butchers and Hang- 
men, by Tormenting poor Innocents, and Inflidting all forts of Pu- 
mffiments upon them. 

Moreover, we were the lels in expectation oPanyfuch thing, fre- 
caufe at the felf fame time they Treated us in this manner, they 
would- needs perfwade us, That the Kings Council had df approved the . 
Defign'. And indeed it feem ? d very probable tons, that all Reafons, 
whether taken from Humanity, Piety, or Intereft, would have made, 
them Difavow and Condemn a Project fo Inhumane and Barbarous : 
Yet now by experience we find it but too true, that our Enemies are fo 
far from rejecting the faid Defign, that they carry it on with an unpa- 
rallel’d Zeal and Application,, without giving themfelves any further 
trouble-tQ effectuate thelr’d£fift?S, than that of doing thefe two things. 

The... 


(%l) 

The firft of which was to Lull us alleep, and to take away from us 
*all matter of Sufpition of the mifehief they were hatching againft us'* 
which they did by permiting fome of our Publick Exercifes of Religion, 
•by giving way to our Building of fome ‘Churches, by fetling Minifters 
in divers places to Baptize our Children, knd by piibiifhing feveral 
Arrefts and Declarations, which did intimate to us, that we had reafon 
to hope we fhould yet Subfift for fome Years : Such was that Decla- 
ration, by which all Minifters were ordered to change their Churches 
every three years. 

The other was to fecure all the Sea-Ports of the Kingdom, fo & 
none might make their efcape, which was done by renewing the An- 
tient Prohibitions of departing the Kingdom without leave, but with 
the addition of far more fevere Penalties. 

After thefe precautions thus taken, they thought themfelves no 
longer oblig’d to keep any meaftires, but immediately lift up the 
hand, to give the laft blow for our Ruinc. The Intendants had order 
to reprefent to us, That the King was refolved to fuffier no other Religion 
in his Kingdom .he fide s his own, and to Command us all in his Name , rea- 
dily to Embrace the fame , without allowing us any longer refpite to con - 
fidef, what we had to do, than a few days , nay hours ; threatfiing tis. 
That if we continued obfiinate, they would force us to it by the extremity 
of Rigour \ and prefently Executing thefe their Menaces , by filling our 
Houfes With Souldiers , to whom we were to be left for a Trey, and who 
not content with entirely Ruining of us, fhould befides exerclfe upon our 
Terfons all the Violence and Cruelty they could poffibly devife : And all 
this to overcome our Conftancy and Perfevcrance. 

Four Months are now paft and gone, fmcc they began to make ufe 
of this ftrangc and horrible way of Converting People, worthy of, 
and well becoming its Inventors. The Country of Bearn w&s firft 
fet upon, as being one of the moft confiderable Out-parts of the King- 
dom, to the end that this mifehievous enterprife gaining ftrength in 
its paflage, might foon after over- whelm, and as it were deluge all 
the other Provinces in the fame Sea of the uttermoft calamity. Mon- 
fieur Foucaut the Intendant, went himfelf in Perfon to all the places 
where we were in any numbers, and commanded all the Inhabitants 
'that were of the Proteftant Religion, under the Penalty of great a- 
mercements, to Affemble themfelves in thole places he appointed to 
|hem ; where being accordingly met together, he charged them in 
the Kings Name to change their Religion, allowing them only a day

& r two to difpofe themfelves for it j he told them, That great num- 
bers of Souldiers were at hand to compel thofe that Jhould refufe to yield 
a ready Obedience ; and this threatning of his being immediately fol- 
lowed by the Effect, as the Lightning is by Thunder, he fill’d the 
Houfes of all thofe who abode conflant in their refolution to Live and 
Dye Faithful to their Lord and Mailer Jefm Chrift, with Souldiers, 
and Commands thofe Infolent Troops (flefh’d with Blood and Slaugh- 
ter) to give them the worft Treatment they could poffihty devife. 

I (hall not undertake, Sir, to. give you a particular account of 
thofe Exceftes and Outrages thefe enraged Brutals committed in Ex- 
ecuting the Orders they were charged with} The Relation would 
prove too tedious and doleful, it {hall fufiice me to tell you, that, 
they did not forget any thing that was Inhumane, Barbarous, or 
Gruel, without having regard to any Condition, Sex or Age, they 
pull’d down and demo! ifhed their Houfes, they fpoil’d, dafh’d to , 
pieces , and burnt their beft Moveables and Houftiold-fluff, they 
bruited and beat to Death Venerable Old Men, they dragg’d Honour- 
able Matrons, to Mafs, without the lead pittyor refpedt, they bound 
and Fetter’d Innocent Perfons, as if they had been the moft Infamous 
and Profligate Villains, they hung them up by their Feet, till tfJey. 
faw them ready to give up the Ghoil, they took Red-hot Fire- (hovels 
and held them clofe to their bare Heads, and actually appty’d them 
to other parts of their Bodies, they Immur’d them within four Walls, - 
where they let them Perifh for Hunger and Thirft ; and the conftancy 
wherewith they fuffer’d all thefe Torments, having had no other ef- 
fect, but that of augmenting the Rage of thefe Furies, they never 
ceafed Inventing new ways of pain and Torture, till their Inhumanity 
at length had got the Victory, and Triumphed over the Patience and 
Faith of thefe miferable Wretches. Infomuch that of all thofe many 
numerous Affemblies we had in that Province , as that of Pau, d* 
Nrthes, de Navarre, &c. there are fear cely left a final! number Who 
either continue conftant in defpite of all thefe Cruelties, or elfe have 
made their efcape into Spain, Holland , England , or elfewhere, leav- 
ing their Goods and Families for a Prey to thefe Mercilefs and Cruel 
Men. 

Succefs having thus far anfwered their expectation, they relblved 
to loofe no time, but vigoronfly Profccuting their work, they imme- 
diately turned their Thoughts and Arms towards Montauban } wher© 
the Intendant having Summoned the Citizens to appear before him,

befoeaks them much in the fame Language, aswasufed to thofe of 
Bearne, whereunto they having returned about the fame Anfwer, he 
orders 4000 Men to enter the City, and makes them take up their 
Quarters, as at Bearne , only in the Houfes of Proteflants , with ex- 
prefs Command to Treat them in like manner, as they had done 
thofe of Bearne : and thefe Inhumane Wretches were fo diligent and 
aftive in Executing thefe pittilefs. Orders, that of 1.2 or 17000 Souls 
of which that Church did confift, not above 20 or jo Families are 
efcaped, who in a doleful and forlorn condition wander uj> and 
down the Woods, and hide themfelves in Thickets. The Ruine of 
this Important place drew after it the delegation of all the Churches 
about it, which were all Enveloped in the fame common Calamity, 
as thofe of Realmont , Bottrniquely Negreplijfe , &C. 

Yet was not the condition of the Churches in the Upper Gusenne 
more Sad and Calamitous, than that of thofe of the Lower Guienne, 
and o f Perirorr, which this horrible deluge hath likewife overwhelm'd.

their Money is gone, they Sell their Houfhold-ftufF, and fell that for

Mother, Wife and Children : Four Souldiers continually hand at the 
door to hinder any from coming in to fucconr or comfort them : 
they keep them in this condition, two, three, four, live, and fix days, 
without either Meat, Drink, or Sleep j on one hand the - Child cries 
with the Languifhing accent of one ready to Dye, Ah my Father ! 
Ah my Mother ! What Jhall / do ? I muft Dye , I can endure no longer : 
The Wife on the other hand cries ; Alajs ! mf Heart fails me , I Faint , 

I Dye j Whilft their cruel Tormentors ate fo far from being touch’d 
with Companion, that from thence they take occafion to prefs them 
afrefh, and to renew their Torments, frighting them with theirHel- 
lifh Menaces, accompanied with moft execrable Oaths and Curfes ; 
crying. Dog, Bougre, IVhat, wilt- not thou be Converted ? Wilt not thou 
be Obedient f Dog, Bougre , Thou mu(l be Converted , xve are fent on

Cruelties, (with which they fcaft their Eyes ) and of all their Infa- 
mous and abominable words, (which ought to cover them with Hor- 
rorand Confufion ) make only a matter of Sport and Laughter of it. 

Thus thefe miferable Wretches, being neither fuffered to Live r.or 
to Dye, (for when they fee them fainting away,' they force them to 
take-fo much- as to keep Body and Soul together) and feeing no other 
way for them to be delivered out of this Hell, in which they are 
continually Tormented , are fain at laft to ftoop under the unfup- 
portable Burthen of thefe extremities : So that excepting only a few 
who faved themfelves by a timely Flight, preferring their Religion 
before aU Temporal 'PofTefTions, all the reft have been conftrained to 
go to Mate. 

Neither is the Country any more exempt from thefe Calamities, 
than Towns and Cities, nor thofe of the Nobility and Gentry, than 
Citizens. They fend whole Companies of Souldiers into Gentlemens 
Houfes, who Treat them in the moft outragious and violent manner- 
conceivable, infomuch that not a Soul can hope to efcape, except it 
may befome few, who like the Believers of old,' wander ijrDefarts* 
and lodge in Dens and Caves of the Earth, - 


Further- - 


Furthermore I can allure you, ^that never was any greater -eon ft er- 
nation; than that which we are in here at prefen t, the Army, we hear 
is cqme very near us, and the Intendant is juft now Arrived in this 
City; the greater part of the moft confiderable Merchants are either 
already gone, or cafting about how be ft to make their efcape, aban- 
doning. their Houfes and Eftates to their Enemies'; and there are not 
wanting fomc Cowardly Spirits, who, to avoid the mifchief they are 
preparing for us, have already promifod to do whatfoever is required 
of them. In a word, nothing is fecn or heard in thefe parts but 
Confirmation, Weeping and Lamentation, there being fcarce a Per- 
fon of our Religion, who hath not his Heart pierced with the bittereft 
Sorrows , and whofe Countenance hath not the Lively Figure of 
Death Imprinted on it : and furely, if our Enemies Triumph in all this 
their Jriumph cannot likely be of any long continuance. 5 

I confefs I cannot perfwade my felf to entertain fo good an opinion 
of them, as to think that ever they will be afhamed of thefe their 
doings, fo Diametrically oppofite to the Spirit of the Gofpel, for I 
know the Gofpel in their accounts paffeth for a Fable : but this I dare 
averr, that this Method of theirs will infallibly lay wafte the King- 
dome, which, according to all appearance, is never like to recover 
of it, and fo in time, they themfelves will be made as fenfible of 
thefe miferies, as others now are. Commerce is already in a manner 
wholly extindl, and there will need little lefs than a Miracle to reco- 
ver it to its former State. What Proteftant Merchants will hence- 
forward be willing to engage themfelves in Trade, either with per- 
fons without Faith, and who have fo cowardly betray’d their Religion 
and Confcience, or with the Outrageous and Barbarous Perfecuters 
of the Religion which they profefs ? and who by thefe eourfes declare 
openly and frankly, that it is their Principle, not to think themfelves 
oblig’d to keep their word with Hereticks ? And who are thofe of 
what Religion foever, that will Negotiate with a State exhaufted by 
Taxes and Subfidies, by Perfocutions, by Barrenneft and Dearth of 
feveral years continuance ; full of a defpairing people, and which 
infallibly will ere long be full of thofe that are proferib’d , and be 
bathing in its’ own Blood. 

And thefe miferable Wretches who have been deceived, by thofe 
who have told them, that it would never be impos’d upon them to 
abjure their Religion, and who are ftupified by the extremity of their 
Sufferings, and the terror of their bloody and cruel Enemies, are wrapt

and remember that they could not embrace the Communion of Rome, 
without abfolutely renouncing the holy Religion they profeffed, and 
when they fhali make a full reflexion upon the unhappy change they 
have been forced to make ,thcn their. Confidences being awakened, and 
continually reproaching their faint-heartednefs, will rend them with 
forrow and remorfe, and inflieft torments upon them, equal to thofe 
the Damned endure in Hell, and will make them endeavour to be de- 
livered from this Anguifh, and to find reft in the conftant pro.eliion of 
that Truth, which they have fo unhappily betray’d. 

And on the other fide, their Enemies will be loath to ta*e the

into which they have precipitated them : but becaufe all the Suffer-

An Extra A of a Letter, containing [orris 


more Infiances of the Cruel and Barba- 


rous uf age of the Frotefiants in France. 


B Ut this. Sir , is not the thing which troubles me mo ft at this 
time, there’s another cauft of my Grief, which is but too juft, 
and even pierceth my Heart with [Sorrow, and that is, the 
Cruel Perfecution which the Poor Proteftants of France do buffer, 
amoflgft whom I have fo many near and dear Relations: the Tor- 
ments they are put to, are almoft Incredible, and the Heavenly 
Courage wherewith feme of them are ftrengrhned by their great 
Captain and Leader to undergo them, is no lefs amazing and worn 
derful; I fhall give for Inftance one or two of thefe Champions, that, 
by them you may judge of the reft. 

A Young Woman was brought before the Council in order to ob- 
lige her to abjure the Truth of theGofpel, which fhe boldly and man- 
fully refufing , was commanded back again to Prifon, where they 
fhaved her Head, and bing’d off the Hair of her Privities, and having 
ftript her Stark-Naked, in this manner led her throngh the Streets 
of the City, where many a blow was given her, and Stones flung at 
her. After this, they fet her up to the Neck in a Tub full of Water, 
where after fhe had been for a while, they took her out, and put 
upon her a fhift dipt in Wine, which as it dry’d, and ftuck to her 
Sore and Bruifed Body, they fnatch’d off again , and then had ano-. 
ther ready, dipt in Wine, to dap upon her, this they repeated fix fe- 
veral times j and when by this Inhumane ufage her Body was become 
very. Raw and Tender, they demanded of her, Whether foe di,d not 
now find her felf difpofed to Embrace the Catholic Faith I lor fo they 
arc pleafed to term their Religion : but fhe being ftrengthned by the 
Spirit and Love of him, for whofe Names fake fhe buffered all theft 
Extremities, undauntedly anfwered, That fhe had before 'declared her 
Refolution to them , which fhe Would never alter ; and that though they 
had her Body in their Power, fhe was refolved not to yield her Soul to 
them, but keep it pure and undefiled for her Heavenly Lover , as know- 
ing that a little, while Would put an end to all her Sufferings^ and give a 



(» 9 ) 

beginning to her Enjoyment of Ezerlafiing Blifs : Which words of hers, 
adding Fuel to their Rage, who now dcfpaired of making her a Con- 
vert, they took andfaftned her by her Feet, to fomething that ferved 
the turn of a Gibbet, and there let her Hang in that Ignominious 
pofturc with her Head downwards, till {he expired. 

The other Perfon I would In ft a nee in, and whom I pity the more, 
bccaufe ( for ought I know) he may yet Survive, and ftill continue 
under the Tormentors hands, is an Old Man, who having for a great 
while been kept clofePrifoner (upon the fame account as the former)) 
in a deep Dungeon, where his Companions were Darknefs and Hor- 
ror, and filthy creeping things, was brought before his Judges with . 
Verniine and Snails crawling upon his Mouldred Garment, who fee- 
ing him in that Loathfome condition, faid to him , How now Old 
, does not jour Heart begin to Relent ? and are not - you willing 
to Abjure your Hare fie ? To which he anfwered •, As for Harefite , 

/ profefs none j but if by that Word you mean my Religion , you may af- 
fure your felves, that as I have thus long Lived, fo I hope , and amre - 
folved by the Grace of God to Dye in it : With which anfwer they be- 
ing little pleafed, but furioufly Ineenfed, befpoke him in a rougher 
Tone: Doft thou not fee that the Worms are about to Devour thee? 
Well , fiince thou art fo refolved, we will fend thee back, again , to the 
Loathfome place from whence thou cameft, that they may make an end 
ef thee , and confume thy Obdurate Heart ; to which he reply d, with 
the words of the Holy Patient job) Novi poflquam vermes co'nfoderint. 
(Corpus) iftud, in came mea me vifurum efifie Deum. I Iznow that after 
Worms have Eaten this Body , that in my Flefh I file all fee God ; and 
having fo faid, he was fent back to his Loathfome dark abode, 
where if he be ftill, I pray God to give him Patience and ftrength to 
hold out to the end, that fo he may obtain the Crown of Life. 

I (hould be too tedious in giving you all the particulars, of their 
Cruelty, and of the Sufferings of th e Prot eft ants, yet I cannot well 
forbear acquainting you with what lately I am moft ci edibly In- 
form’d off, which take as follows * Some Dragoons who were Quar- 
tered with a Perfon, whom they could by no means oblige to Re- 
nounce his Religion, upon a time when they had well fill’d thenv 
felves with Wine, _and broke their Glaftes at every Health they drank, 
and fo fill’d the Floor where they were with the Fragments, and by 
often walking over, and treadling upon them, reduced them to lefler 

nieces and Fiaftions, and being now in a Merry humour, they mud 
1 ■ ; d i nee, is 


( 20 ) 

aeeds g© to Dance, and told their Hoft that he mu ft be one of the 
Company, but withal, that he muft firft pull off his Stockings and 
Shoes, that he might moove the more nimbly } in a word, they forc’d 
him to Dance with them barefooted upon the (harp points of Glafr, 
which when the^ had continued fo long as they were able to keep 
him on his Legs, they laid him down on a. Bed, and a while after ftript 
him Stark-Naked, and roled his Body from one end of the Room to 
the other upon the (harpGlafs, as before- mentioned, which having 
done, till his Skin was (hick full of the faid little Fragments, they re- 
turned him agaiuto his Bed, and Lent for a Chirurgeon, to takeout 
all the faid pieces of Glafs out of his Body, which you may eafily con- _ 
ceive could not be done without frequent Incifions, and horrible and * 
moft extreaip pain. Another Perfon being likewife troubled with the 
unwelcome Company of thefe Dragoons, and having fuffered extream- 
ly at their hands, without the expedted fuccefs of his Converfion, one 
of them on a time looking earnelUy upon him, told him, That he dif- 
fyured himf elf with letting his Beard grove fo long\ but he anfwering, 
That they were the caufe of it, who would not let hi,m fiir ^out of door, for 
to go to the Barber', the Dragoon reply’d, I can ,, do that for you as 
well as the Barber, and with that told him, he<mujl needs try his Skill up- 
on him, and fo fell to work, butdnftead of (having him, flea’d all the 
Skin off his Face : oneoLhis Companions coming in at the cry of this 
poor Sufferer, and feeing what he had done, feemingly blam’d him 
for it, and faid, He was aSunglar, and then to his Hoft, Come your 
Hair wants Cutting too, and you JhaU fee I will do it much better than 
he hath Jbav’d you a and thereupon begins in a moft Cruel manner, to 
pluck the Hair, Skin. andall,<off his Head, and flea’d that as the other 
had done his Chin. Thus making a Sport and Merriment of the ex* 
tream Suffering of thefe miferablc Wretches. 

By> thefe Inhumane, and more than Barbarous means, it is that they 
endeavour to overcome the moft refblved Patience, and to drive Peo- 
ple to defpair and Faint- hear tednefs, by their more then Devilifn In- 
ventions.. They refufe to give them Death, which they defire, and 
only keep them alive to Torment them, fo long till they have Van- 
q.uifh’d their Perfeverance, for the Names of Martyrs and Rebels are 
equally odious to their Enemies, who tell them, That the King will 
have Obedient Subjects,, but neither Martyrs nor Rebels, and that they have 
received Orders to Convert them , but not to Kill them. 

Sir , v

Your Faithful Friend,

The Frofefiion of the Cat ho lick, Apofioltck , 
and Roman Faith, which the Revolting 
Proteftants in France are to Sub firm 
and Swear to. . 

J N the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghcfi, 
Amen. I Believe and Confefs with a firm Faith, 
all and every thing and things contained in the Creed 
which is ufed by the Holy Church of Rome y :vi%*>l 
receive and embrace raoli fineerely the Apoftolick 
and Ecclefiaftical Traditions, and other obfervances 
of the faid Church , In like manner I receive the Scrip- 
tures, but in the fame fenfe as the faid Mother Church, 
hath, and doth now underftand and Expound the 
fame, for whom and to whom it only doth belong to 
judge of the Interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures • 
and I will never take them, nor underHand-them o~ 

therwile 



(it) 

tlierwife than according to tire unanimous content of 

the Father's. - 

I profefs that there be truly and properly leven 
Sacraments of the New Law, inftituted by our Lord 
Jefus Chrift, and neceflary for the Salvation of Man- 
kind, altho not equally heedful for every one, viz,. 
Baptifm , Confirmation , the Encharift, Penance, Extream 
VnBion, Orders and Marriage-, and that they do con- 
fer Grace . and that Baptifm and Orders may not be 
reiterated without Sacriledge : I receive and admit 
alfo the Ceremonies received and approved by the 
Catholick Church in the folemn adminiftration of the 
forementioned Sacraments. _ ; r 

I receive and embrace all and every thing and things 
which have been determined concerning Original Sin 
and Jollification by the holy Council of Trent . 

Iltkewife profefs, that in the Mafs there is offered 
up to God, a true, proper, atid propitiatory Sacrifice 
for the Living and Dead ; and that in the holy Sacra- 
ment of the bucharifi, there is truly, really , andfttb- 
fi antially, the Body and Blood, together with the Soul 
and Di-vinity of the Lord Jefus Cbrifi ■ and that in it 
there is made a change of the whole fubffance of the 
Bread into his Body, and of the whole fubftance of 
the Wine into his Blood, which change the Catholick 
Church calls Tranfubflaiitiatjon. I confefs alfo, that 
under one only of thefe two Elements, whole Chrift 
and the true Sacrament is received, . I 



( 2 5 ) 

1 conftantly believe and affirm, that there is a Pur- 
gatory, and that the Souls there detained, are relieved 
by the Suffrages of the Faithful. 
fesJ n hke manner, I believe that the Saints reigning in 
Glory with JefusChrift, are to be Worshipped and 
Invocated by us, and that they offer up Prayers to God 
for us, and that their Reiiques ought to be honoured. 

Moreover, I do moft fted fail ly avow, that the 
Images of JefusChrift, of the Bleffed Virgin, |the Mo- 
ther of God, and of other Saints, ought to be kept and 
retained, and that due Honour and Veneration muff 
be yielded unto them. 

Alfo I do affirm, that the power or Indulgence was 
left to the Church by Chrift Jelus, and that the ule 
thereof is very beneficial to Chriftians. 

I do acknowledge the holy Catholick, Apoftolick, 
and Roman Church, to be the Mother and Miftrefs of 
all other Churches j and I profels and fvvear true obe- 
dience to the Pope of Rome, Succejfor of the Bleffed St a 
Peter, Prince of the Apofiles , and Vicar of Jefus Chrift . 

In like manner lown and profefs, without doubting 3 
all other things left defined and declared by the holy 
Cations and General Coilncils, especially by the moft 
holy Council of Trent* and withal, Ido condemn, 
reject, and hold for accurfed, all things that are con- 
trary thereto . and all thofe Herefies which have been 
condemned, rejected, and accurfed by the Church.

Andasfor any bufinefs of Law, or matter of difference which may

pTcaufe in the Edl& of the frenih King, the perpeMhnd 
JJ irrevocable Edift of Nantes is recall’d arid abolished, I thought 
fit (becaufe die whole Ed id would be too long to be infer ted 
here) to give you feme parages of the Prefatory part of it, where- 
by it may appear what ftrefs was laid on it by Henry the IVJ 
(called the Great) Grandfather to the preferit French King, and 
how much he judged the exaft maintaining of it would conduce 
to the Settlement, Peace, and Profperity of his Kingdom. 

Now it hath pleafed God to give us a beginning of enjoy- 
c< ing fome Reft, we think we cannot employ our felves better,

6C of his holy Name, and to provide that he may be Adored and 
<€ grayed to by all our Subjeds j and if it hath not yet pleafed

« c bles and-Tumults • and that we and this Kingdom may always 
« confers the glorious Tide of Cfeifitatl, and by the 
fame means take away the Cauie of Mifchief and Trouble, 
< c which may happen from the actions of Religion, which of all 
< c others are moft prevalent and penetrating. For this caufe, 
c< acknowledging this affair to be of the greateft Importance, 
« and worthy of the beft confideration, after having confidered 
the Papers of Complaints oi our Gatholick Subjects, and hav- 
« iag alfo permitted to our Subjects of the Reformed Religion, 
“ toafTemble themfeives by Deputies for framing their Com- 
< f plaints, and making a Collection of all their Remonftrances, 
<« and having thereupon conferred divers times with them , we 
« have upon the whole judged itnecefey, to give to all our faid 
« Subjeas one General Law, clear, plain, and abfolute,
