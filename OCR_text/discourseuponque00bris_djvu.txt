ADVERTISEMENT of the Tranflator. 

I AM fenfble I owe an apology , for offer- 
ing the following Tranjlation to the Public ; yet 
prefumptuQUs as it may appear , I am far frpm be- 
ing without fpecious reafons to jujtify this pre- 
emption. Ever unable to fupprejs thofe National 
feelings , excited by the reading of - the ener- 
getic and mafterly pieces which our Revolution has 
produced , though a citizen of this country and 
happy under its government , I Jlill remember that 
I am a Frenchman , and indulge thofe enthufafic 
feelings , always confequent upon the perufal of a 
fpirited and beautiful piece of compoftion , efpec- 
lally when it comes from that quarter . To com- 
municate the fe feelings to the Public was my inten- 
tion, in the undertaking of the prefent tranfation ; 
and , if in the performing of it, I fall fhort of the 
original , and am left with little more, to prefent to 
the public , than the intention, I fill hope they 
will have the indulgence to receive it, and in th ax 
refolve its imperfections. 

The fubjecl upon which the following Difcourfe 
was delivered, is one of the newefi and mojl inter - 
efling in the world. It is of the utmojl import- 
ance to the French Nation : It cannot be indiffer- 
ent to the Americans. The part the Author has 
aRed, and his opinion on the fubjelt, declared in 
fo formal a manner , mufi render it fo much the 
more inter efling to this people, fo converfant with 
the Liberties and Rights of Mankind, as the ex- 
ample of their courage and political knowledge has 
been the great focus, where France has acquired 
her light, and of courfe the means of recovering 

hex

her liberties. America cannot but fee zvith pteaf , 1 
ure.a diffujion of fentvnents , which their author 
imbibed during his rejidence here. The gentle - 
man' sykar after alfo , his p re fent Jituation and in- 
Jluence in politics , to fay nothing of many other 
well known circumflances , * may be confidered as 
favourable to the reception of the following Jheets. 

* M. Warville has publifhedhis Travels through 
the United States ; I find fome inaccuracies in the 
topographical part of them, which might give an 
unfavourable idea of the whole work. It is not, 
however, to be judged from this circumftance, as 
he himfelf fays that he travels “ not for a geogra- 
pher, but for a philofopher and a patriot.” The 
fhort flay which he made here not allowing him to 
afeertain many topographical points, which require 
a time he thought he could fpend to more advan- 
tage. 



•'GENTLEMEN, 

T HE important queftfon, which you are now 
debating, comprizes five particulars, which 
are all equally interefting. 

ill. Shall the King be tried ? 

2d. By whom (hall he be tried ? 

3d. In what form lhall he be tried ? 

4th. In what manner (hall his place in the in- 
terim be fupplied ? 

5th. How lhall it be finally fupplied, if he be 
depofed ? 

Each of thefe queflions ought to be difcufled 
feparately,, with that deliberation, that refleftion, 
which the importance of this national profecu- 
tion requires ; with that folemnity which ought 
to furround a nation, which, with that liberty, 
with that freedom of opinion, which character- 
izes the friends of truth, accufes one of its repre- 
fentatives with the greatefl of crimes. 

M. Petion, in the laft feflion, wifely confined 
the then difcufiion to the firfl of thefe queflions : 
Shall , can the King be tried ? To that boundary, 
which he fixed upon, and which you feemed to 
approve, I fhall confine myfelf. I fhall not, 

therefore, 



6 


therefore, at prefent, treat of any of the fubfequent 
queftions ; though our adverfaries endeavour to 
keep them up, to mix and confound them, in or- 
der to lead the mind affray, to fill it with preju- 
dices againft the fevere meafures, which the in- 
tereft, juftice and majefty of the Nation require. 
It is not, gentlemen, that we dread the combat, 
which is offered us by our adverfaries. No, 
when the proper time fhall come, we will prove 
to them, that whether the King preferve his 
throne, or his place be otherwife fupplied, the 
fafety of the people, the fafety of the conftitution, 
require, that the throne be furrounded by a coun- 
cil, which, holding its powers from the people, 
may infpire confidence into the people. We 
will prove to them that this form, far from alter- 
ing the French Conftitution, is agreeable to that 
conftitution, agreeable to its fundamental princi- 
ples : We fhall prove to them, that they are ig- 
norant, or pretend to be ignorant of thefe princi- 
ples ; that they have always been in a delirium, 
or deceived in their charges againft Republican- 
ifm ; that, while under this vague term, they ca- 
lumniate the reprefentative government, they ca- 
lumniate the French Conftitution : we fhall prove 
to them, that thofe whom they call republicans, 
are the firmeft defenders of that conftitution : In 
fine, we fhall prove to them, that the mode of the 
eleftive council, already laid before this tribunal, 
is the only one capable of reftoring confidence in 
the executive power, and confequently its force 
and energy, of courfe, peace and harmony ; while 
the mode propofed by them, is only adapted to 
load the French people with reproach, by fprcad- 
ing difcord and anarchy. 


Then, 


Then, gentlemen, in this folemn difcuflion, 
which I hope will be admitted in this affembly, the 
mifunderftanding which divides the patriots will 
entirely difappear ; the mifunderftanding which 
the artifice and calumnies of our enemies keep 
up, and of which one word more may deftroy the 
poifon. 

What would they have, who rife up here, in 
oppofition to republicans ? fearing anarchy, fee- 
ing it in tumultuous alfemblies, they dread, they 
deteft the democracies of Athens and of Rome ; 
they dread the divifion of France into confeder- 
ate republics ; they want nothing but the French 
Conftitution, a reprefentative conftitution ; they 
are right. 

What, on the other hand, do they want, who 
are called republicans ? they dread, they equally 
reject the tumultuous democracies of Athens and 
of Rome ; they equally dread the eighty three 
confederate republics ; they defire nothing but 
the reprefentative, homogeneous conftitution of 
all b ranee together. W e are therefore all agreed ; 
we all want the French Conftitution. 

The only thing which divides us in appear- 
ance is reduced to this : The Supreme Executive 
has betrayed his truft has lo lithe confidence of the 
Nation. Can there remain a doubt, if he fhould 
be reftored, or the infant put in his place, whether 
to furnifh him with an eleflive council,, which 
may infpire confidence, fo neceffary in thefe 
times of confufion ? The patriots fay no ; they 
who would make the belt of a defpifed King, or 
of his feeble fucceffor, lay yes, and cry out againft 
Repu b lie an ifm , that thofe, on the civil lift , may 
not be cried out againft. There*’ gentlemen, is, 
R the 


8 


the whole myftery ; there is the key of this ri- 
diculous accufation of republicanifm. There is 
here, therefore, no conteft, but between princi- 
ples and a concealed ambition ; between the 
friends of the conflitution and the friends ot the 
civil lijl. 

But before difcufling what method of fupply- 
ing the place of Royalty is beft, it is.indifpenfa- 
bly necefiary to examine, whether the King fhall 
be tried, for if he is not, the fecond enquiry be- 
comes ufelefs. 

I return, therefore, to the only queftion, which 
I propofed to treat of to day. I owed you this 
preliminary remark, In order to eftablilh the fra- 
ternal affe&ion, which unites us all, to diffipate 
the anxieties, which thofe felt, who thought they 
law a violation of our conftitutional principles, 
in the difapprobation, or in the approbation of re- 
publican principles, and who lamented the 
fchifm. 

Shall the King be tried ? 

This queftion involves two — can he be tried ? 
ought he to be tried ? The committees maintain 
that he neither can, nor ought to be tried : With 
regard to the firft, they are countenanced by tbs 
facrednefs of the King’s perfon ; in regard ol the 
fecond, by the fear ol foreign powers ; it is to 
thefe two arguments, that I fhall confine my- 
lelf. 

I come, in the firft place, to that of inviola- 
bility. 

M. Petion had good reafon to tell you, that he 
did not conceive how this queftion made one of 
them ; for if we confult common fenfe, the dec- 
laration ot rights, the conftitution, the cuftoms ot 

free 


9 


free nations, thofe of our anceflors, the opinions 
of the moil efteemed authors, A criminal 
king., sacred, is the moll; fhocking abfurdity. 

We are not fpeaking of the conftitutional in- 
violability of the King, of that, by the aid of 
which the King is not refponfible for his a£ts of 
adminiflration ; that now cannot be difputed ; 
though that is but a fi&ion,' it is not a dangerous 
one ; becaufe a£Is of this fort being always to. 
be counterfigned by a refponfible minifler, the 
people always have them guaranteed under his 
hand. 

But this facrednefs is pretended to be applica- 
ble to all the external and perfonal acfs of the 
King : It is pretended that he himfelf is facred, 
whether he openly invades the rights and fafety 
of individuals, or attacks the liberty of his coun- 
try with armed force. 

This do&rine proves the danger of introducing 
fi&ions, into conffitutions. It has been faid af- 
ter the Englifh, “ The King can do no wrong as 
a King therefore he is inviolable ; and court- 
iers and valets of the King conclude, from thence, 
that the King can do no wrong as an individual* 
and of confequence can never be tried, nor pun- 
ifhed, though he fhould commit the moft horrid 
crimes. If, fay they, you admit his infallibility, 
as King, why fhould you not admit it as a man ? 
he is always the fame man, and the fecond fiftion 
is not more fhocking than the firfb. 

I do not come here, even to juftify the firft in- 
violability itfelf ; I fubmit to it, it has been de- 
creed ; but I maintain, that if the fecond be ad- 
mitted, there will no more remain, either princi- 
ples, or declaration of rights, Qr fafety of the Na- 



10 


tion, or conftitution, or liberty. Good fenfe, in- 
deed, would have punifhment the confequence of 
a crime ; and not to apply punifhment where 
there is a crime, is to encourage it. 

Common fenfe would not have a man declared 
impeccable , while he is but a man, nor declared 
unpunifhable, fince heaven has not made him 2?/z- 
peccable. The Egyptians, who alfo believed roy- 
alty a neceffary element of government, but who 
were defirous of being delivered from the evil, 
which their animated Kings did them, put a ftone 
into their place, fetting it on the throne. The 
Seiks* put the Alcoran and a drawn fword on it ; 
and live like republicans ; if the ftone and the 
Alcoran are unpunifhable, they are at leaft im- 
peccable ; they do not confpire againft the na- 
tion. 

The declaration of rights would have all the 
citizens upon a par in the eye of the law. Now 
this equality no longer exifts, from the moment 
that one man is above the law ; and the declara- 
tion of rights is infenfibly annihilated, in every 
article, from the moment that one has the audac- 
ity to trample a fingle one of them under feet. 

The fovereignty of the nation acknowledges 
no perfon above itfelf. Now if one man has the 

{ privilege of confpiring againft the nation, without 
Deing obnoxious to punifhment, it is clear that 
this privileged. being is the fovereign, and that 
the nation is his flave. 

In him, I fee nothing but a Deity, and twenty 
five millions of brutes or bond flaves in the pre- 
tended citizens. 

The 

* Officers among the Turks — tranflaior * 



The conftitution wills that all powers fhould be 
derived from the people ; that ail fhould be fub- 
ordinate to the people. Now the univerfal and 
perpetual facrednefs of one man cannot be deriv- 
ed from the people : For they can make nothing 
greater than themfelves ; and to make any one 
greater than themfelves, is to overthrow that fub- 
ordination, in which all the delegates of the peo- 
ple ought to be, in refpefd to them. 

The conftitution fays, the Nation , the Law and 
the King ; but the partifans of inviolability place 
the King firft, and not along fide, but above the 
nation, and the laws. Thus if you admit abfo- 
lute inviolability, this beautiful arrangement of 
political elements, which covers you with glory, 
in the eyes of the world, mu ft be changed. 

The liberty of aclion knows no bounds, but 
the right of other people. Whenever an individual 
has the privilege of leaping all bounds, with re- 
fpe£I to other perfons, and of preventing others 
doing the like, with regard to his own, it is evi- 
dent, there can be neither liberty, nor juftice : 
For liberty and juftice fuppofe a reciprocity of 
rights and of duties : Now here the rights are all 
on one fide, and the duties on the other. 

But if the inviolability of the King overthrows 
common fenfe, the declaration of rights, the fove- 
reigntyof the nation, the conftitution, and liberty, it 
is evident, that it neither is nor can be in our 
conftitution : It is evident, that thofe, who de- 
fend it, are the enemies of the people, of the con- 
ftitution, and of liberty ; it is evident that if this 
fyftem was admitted, it would infenfibly over- 
throw all thofe foundations ; for in the cafe of 
conftitutions, one evil always brings on ten others, 
which are grafted on the fir ft. 

C Our 




Ouradverfaries agree that this abfolute inviola- 
bility, is not yet decreed ; but they fay it is nec- 
effary it fhould be ; they fay it is derived from 
the inviolability of adminiftration. 

We have already feen what difference there 
was between thefe two inviolabilities : What ! 
becaufe one arm is affe&ed with the palfy, does 
it follow that it would be a bleffing to be a para- 
lytic, in all the other limbs ? 

Alas ! is it poffible to calculate all the evils 
which a like privilege of abfolute inviolability 
may bring on ! I do not fpeak of mad or drunken 
freaks, which may debafe the mind of a prince, 
fure of impunity ; I do not call to mind the tafle 
of that prince, who, without being a King, how- 
ever, amufed himfelf with killing men as he 
would rabbits ; nor of fo many inviolable def- 
pots, fo many Tiberius’, fo many Neros, who, for 
their own private amufement, plunged thoufands 
of unfortunate perfons into dungeons, and who 
forced the moil virtuous men to fwallow death 
in poifon. 


But I fhall put one fingle queflion to one of 
thofe intrepid advocates for crowned impunity : 
What would he fay, if the King, in his diverfion, 
fhould debauch his wife ? carry off his daughter, 
fecal his money, burn his honfe, threaten his life ? 
would he fay to him, Lord , let thy will he done ? 
The moft cowardly Have would be afhamed of 
this language. W ould he cite the law to him ? 
that was not made for a King. Would he repel 
his injury with armed force P He is inviolable, 
he is the Lord's anointed. Here, therefore, he 
muff be either the meaneft of mortals, or violate 
one who is inviolable, fince the law dares not 
punifh him. How are we embarralfed, how have 




*3 

we, evfen our own throats cut, when we abandon 
common fenfe, nature, and the rights of man ! it 
would be even cutting his throat, who would be 
favoured with privileges fo contrary to all. For 
to forbid the fword of the law to touch a culpa- 
ble individual, is to deliver that culprit to the 
fword of all thofe, whom he had it in his power 
to injure ; it is to give him twenty enemies, 
twenty hangmen, in order to fave him from the 
hands of a fingle one. 

Doubtlefs, here gentlemen, your memory will 
remind you of a number of princes, who have 
been undone, merely by this inevitable influence 
of inviolability, unhappily attached to abfolute 
power : It will remind you of numerous alfaffina- 
tions, numerous depofitions of princes, whom 
their inviolability carried to the greateff exceffes. 
It will remind you of fo many bloody pages of 
the hiftory of the lower Empire , and of Turkey. 
It is from the 'doctrine of this country, that our 
champions of inviolability would infefit the pure 
fources of our immortal conflitution. Alas ! to. 
what lengths do not the confequences of this im- 
pious doflrine carry ? They cover with its own 
veil, even the wars, which a prince may under- 
take againfl the liberty of his own country. I 
would here afk one of the advocates of inviola- 
bility, if the King, after palling over our fron- 
tiers Ihould not return to France again, unlefs 
at the head of a foreign or a rebellious army, 
carrying fire and fword every where ; if he fhould 
have laid wafie our molf delightful fields ; if, in 
his mad career, he fhould be taken, after feveral 
battles, dare anfwer me, what would you do 
with him ? Would you alledge his being facred, 
in order to abfolve him, and fet him at liberty l 

Yes, 





*4 

Yes, anfwers a member of a committee, coldly. 
Well, then go to Conftantinople, and get fhac- 
kles — carry your infamous do&rine there — it is 
blocking here to Freemen. 

This example, gentlemen, ought to ftrike you; 
if there is a perfonal crime in a King, where fa- 
crednefs cannot fcreen him from the fword of the 
taw, it is plain that other crimes which do violence 
to fociety, cannot rather efcape it. For who lhall 
£x the exaft line ? By what rule fliall it be drawn ? 

By that of the good of fociety, it will be an- 
fwered ; the maintenance of order is in the 
facrednefs of the King : If you take that from 
him, he will be attacked every day. 

I have not, I confefs, fufficient depth of un- 
deritanding to conceive how abfurdity and out- 
rage are the necelfary elements of a good gov- 
ernment. How long has poifon been the necef- 
fary element of life ? I have not an eye fuffi- 
ciently penetrating to difeern the relations which 
conneft the facrednefs of a criminal, with the 
general maintenance of order. On the contrary, 
I fee in it the fource ot the greateft diforders, 
and an excufe for the greateft criminals. Call 
to mind this ftriking expreflion, pronounced by a 
Judge, at this tribunal : “ Should I go,” faid lie 
“ to condemn an affajjin , in the name of the King ?” 
he will tell me, “ you condemn me in the name oj 
a man , who would overthrow the Conjlitution, 
cover France zvith Jlreams of blood , and who, not - 
withjlanding, fill enjoys the throne l” 

Under a free government, gentlemen, order is 
maintained only by the example of order; juf- 
tice, only by perfonal fubjeftion to juftice ; and 
it is not by giving a general certificate ol impuni- 
ty that the number of crimes is diminifhed.

I fee trie Prefident, or ele&ive King of the 
United States, is amenable before the law, capa- 
ble of being fufpended, and condemned for the 
crime of high treafon. I do not fee that this law 
has expofed any Prefident to be every day tor- 
mented with falfe accufations ; but there has not, 
indeed, been any Prefident of the Unite i> 
States, who has confpired againft his country : 
He knows that he fbould be inevitably hanged ; 
and this certainty appears to me a better preferva- 
tive againft confpiracies than inviolability, which 
is nothing but a patent, an exclufive privilege to 
confpire at pleafure. 

Mr. Goupill has cited to you the example of 
England, which has declared its King facred. 
Fine indeed ! gentlemen ; it is this very example, 
on which I fupport myfelf, in order to overthrow 
the fyftem of abfoiute inviolability, held by our 
adverfaries. 

The Englifh admit, in the King, that facred- 
nefs of adminiftration which our conftitution has 
confecrated. 

They go farther than we do ; they extend it 
to the private aftions of the King, which he 
may exercife towards his fubje&s. “ The perform 
offended, ” fays Blackftone,* “ ought to be pro-, 
vided for in the Court of Chancery, or the of- 
ficer of juftice fhall adminifter juftice to him, 
not as a right, but as a favour, and without be- 
ing compelled to iu” Is it by this abjeft lan- 
guage, that we can diftinguifh a free people ? 

But notwithftanding this mean cringing, never 
did the Englifh think their King could be facred, 
while he was endeavouring tb overthrow the con-f 

ftitutioii

flitution by flratagems or by force. Read Locke,* 
Sidney, Milton, Macaulay ; read Blackftone 
himfejf; read the celebrated Jones, chief Judge 
of Bengal, in his fo much peffecuted Dialogue ; 
you will fee, they all unanimoufly hold the 
Prince may be tried, may be depofed by the na- 
tion ; and that his facrednefs ceafes in cafe of a 
narional crime. 

Mr. Goupill has cited you an axiom, very old, 
he fays ; the axiom that the King of England 
can do no wrong, and is impeccable. Very 
fine ! gentlemen, this axiom, fo old, of about a 
hundred years Handing, was invented for the 
convenience of Charles II, who wanted to be a 
defpot, and yet not undergo the fate of his father. 

But I myfelf will cite an axiom fomewhafc 
older, and more true ; the axiom that the. King 
is fubjeft to the law ; it is coeval with the Eng- 
lifh monarchy ; you will find it in the mirrour 
of Parliaments , in Lajleta , Bract on. Forte/cue. 

But I come to the Englifh politics, q 1 late 
date. 

“ When the executive power, fays Locke, t 
would attack the conflitution, it lets itfelf at war 
with the people, who may. refill him and punilh 
him. This power was delegated to the fupreme 
in office only for the general good ; if he vio- 
lates this end, the truft ought to be revoked. But 
by whom ? By him who appointed him. It

his Reply to Salmafius ; Sidney in his Difcourfes on 
Government ; Macaulay in her Differtations, to- 
wards the end of the fourth volume of the Hiftory 
of the Stuarts ; Jones in the Dialogue, printed by 
the Dean of St. Afaph.

there wfcs not this legal form to check tyrants, it 
would be necefl’ary to appeal to the fword for it.” 

Obferve that Locke here, would have the 
Prince tried by the people in convention , and 
not by the Parliament \ and Blackftone, though 
a zealous defender of the prerogatives of the 
King and of the Parliament, does himfelf preach 
up this dodfrine. 

If, fays he,* (and I tranflate his words with a 
fcrupulous exadlnefs) “ any future prince fhould 
exert himfelf to overthrow the conftitution by 
breaking the original compafl* between the King 
and the people ; if he fhould break the funda- 
mental laws; if he fhould withdraw from the 
kingdom, we are authorized to declare, that this 
concourfe of circumftances would be equivalent 
to an abdication, and that the throne ought to 
be declared vacant.” 

Does not Blackftone appear to have had in 
view, the cafe in which, we ourfelves now are ? 
All the circumftances are found in it ; he has 
pafled judgment on the fugitive and perjured 
Frenchman. 

It was, gentlemen, in thefe terms, that the 
fentence or adl of the convention, in 1688, was 
palled againft James II, which declared, that 
“ King James II, having attempted to over- 
throw tne conftitution of this kingdom, by 
breaking the compadt between him and his peo- 
ple ; having by the advice of Jefuits, and other 
evil-minded perfons, violated the fundamental 
laws, has abdicated the government, and that the 
throne is vacant.” 

Obferve here, gentlemen, one ftriking cir- 
cumftance ; it was not the Parliament which 

pronounced 

* See Blackftone^ vol. I. page 245. 



pronounced this fentence of degradation againft 
King James : It was a convention of deputies 
nominated for this particular purpofe, ( ad hoc J 
folely to expel the tyrant, and to fupply his 
place. 

This example, gentlemen, upon which the 
prefent conftitution of England refts, therefore 
overthrows the fyflem of the facrednefs of Kings, 
in cafes of national high treafon. 

James I, that King who was fo prodigioufly 
infatuated with the privileges of royalty, had 
himfelf confecrated this do&rine, “ Every 
King,” faid Ee, “ who would not be a tyrant, 
nor have the fate of tyrants, ought to be fubje£l 
to the law. Ele who maintains the contrary, is a 
viper and a peft.” 

This is the name, which, according to this 
King, we muft give to thofe contemptible law- 
yers of the lower Empire, who are always fure 
to be quoted; to that Ulpian, who had the infa- 
my to affert that “ The Emperor was neither 
obliged to obey the law , nor was amenable in the 
eye of the law and to thofe lawyers of the 
times of the barbarity of France, who, whether 
from a fuperftitious idolatry towards royalty, or 
from intereil;, aided princes, with their criminal 
maxims, to rivet the fetters of their fubje&s. 

I would here, by means of one of the moll 
abje£t fticklers for abfolute re ity, confound 
the men who fhall cite to you the whims of 
the old fchool. The Jefuit Mariana did, in the 
lafl century, compofe a book upon the eftablilh- 
ment of the King, where we find him, for two 
chapters, upon this queftion, Whether a tyrant 
ovght to be Jlabbedor poifoned? Mariana himfelf 
made no doubt of it : Here is the method lie pre- 

feribes. 


fcribos. A tyrant, fays he, is a wild bead:, which 
tears to peices every thing it meets with ; and it 
is a duty to kill a wild bead: ; but how fhall we 
manage with a tyrant, fays Mariana ? He muft 
be reminded of his faults in a friendly manner ; 
but if he rejeffs the advice, and is incorrigible, 
the State ought to pronounce him, fallen from 
Royalty : If he makes oppofition to the fentence, 
he mud: be declared a public enemy, and, by all 
means, be deftroyed. 

Obferve that Mariana wrote his Leflures on 
Tyrannicide, under the mod; defpotic prince, un- 
der Philp II. 

This prince did not himfelf believe the abfo- 
lute facrednefs of fovereigns ; he did not be- 
lieve that it was an effential attribute of Royalty ; 
he did not believe that Royalty might be deftroy- 
ed, if the prince could be tried and puriifhed„ 
And how many examples rife up againft the con-, 
trary doftrine of our adverfaries, who endeavour 
to frighten people at the abolition of Royalty, id’ 
the King can be tried. 

What ! did not Royalty always continue among 
the Jews, though the Sanhedrin could try and 
condemn the Kings ? For, fays Maimonides, the 
Kings of David’s race, tried, and were themfelves 
•tried. 

Did not Royalty always fubfift at Sparta, 
though the Senate of Twenty-eighty and the 
Ephori, might condemn their King' to a fine, to 
imprifonment, to baninfhment, and to death ? 
Witnefs the. examples of Fatifanias, of Cleomenes 
and of Agis. 

In fine, to quote examples from our own hid 
fory ; did not Royalty always fiibfift in France,, 
though, efpecially under the two firft families, the- 
D Kings, 


Kings were frequently depofed, for mai-adminiL 
tration, and even for want of learning ? 

What ! gentlemen, fhould we, in an age of light 
and liberty, in the midft oi the molt altonifhing 
revolution, of a revolution which has reftored to 
man all his rights ; to reafon her whole Empire 

in politics Ihould we have lefs information, 

lefs courage than in the times of ignorance and 
flavery ? By what abfurd contradiction can we 
acknowledge an individual above the law, while 
we put the law above every thing ? 

Eternal contradictions are the portion of the 
advocates for error ; and I find one here, between 
the fyftem and conduCt of our adversaries, which 
condemns them. If the King is facred, he can 
neither be purfued, tried, nor punilhed for any 
crime whatever ; why then, have they themfelves 
voted for his being arretted, and for the fufpenfion 
of his powers, ,are not his being hopped and 
fufpended punifhment, formal attacks upon that 
facrednefs ? Yes, doubt lefs, it is neceftary, there- 
fore, either to declare that the King is not facred, 
in the cafe of a national crime, or we mutt let 
him loofe. XHie is facred, the National Aftbm- 
bly, and thofe who have arretted him, mutt ac- 
knowledge to him the right of a criminal profe- 
cution ; he mutt be left at liberty to go where he 
thinks proper. Let that enemy, therefore, who 
could give fo perfidious an advice,- to give him his 
liberty, which might foon be followed by all the 
honors of civil war. Let him dare ttiow himfelf. 
Alas ! gentlemen, this is the Situation to which the 
fyftem of abfolute facrednefs has brought us ; tor, 
what Frenchman could ever obey a dcfpicable and 
criminal King, though he were facred ? 

I believe, gentlemen, that I have fufliciently 
demonftratecl it to you ; It is neceffary here, ei- 
ther 


21 


ther to adopt the conftitution, or the abfolute fa- 
crednefs of the King ; either the revolution, or 
his trial ; either the fafetv of the people, or out- 
rageous revenge ; either the glory , or the reproach 
of France. 

I pafs to the fecond argument of our adverfa- 
ries. It is more perfidious than the firft, more 
fpecious, more adapted to lead affray, it muff, 
therefore be examined with care. The King, f^y 
the committees, cannot be brought to the bar — he 
cannot be tried, without exposing ourfelvesto the 
vengeance of foreign powers. They reprefent, 
to the National Affembly, a frightful piCfure of 
the calamities, which their confederacy, their in- 
vafion would bring upon prance. It is with 
thefe imaginary terrors, that they hope to rank, 
on the fide of an odious party, a multitude of vir- 
tuous, but timid, or ill-informed patriots. The 
delufion muff be difpelled, and thefe puerile ter- 
rors removed : We muff analyze the grounds of 
them ; and the mind being brought back to rea- 
fon, and direCled by principle alone, will fee, in. 
cool blood, what ought, and wliat can be done 
with the King. 

It is not the firff time, gentlemen, that this ar- 
tifice has been ufed, to lead the National Affembly 
into an error. Whenever they would flagger it, 
and withdraw it from its principles, they repre- 
fent to it, in diffant views, wars and innumerable 
calamities, call to mind the affair of the colonies. 
To hear fuperficial men, who fee nations, only 
through a falfe, minifferial, diplomatic prifm, fay 
the Englifh fleets will certainly fall upon our 
iflands. The National Affembly had the good 
fenfe to fcorn thofe fears. How many months 
have ebpfed fince thefe haughty predictions ! 

The 


The Englifh fleets are ftill in their harbours, or 
coafting in the channel. I cite to you this exam- 
ple, to put you on your guard againftthis haughty 
policy, which, having reafon at home, goes in 
queft of lies abroad ; and fuch is the artifice which, 
at this day, is ftill made ufe of, to abfolve, with- 
out trial, a man who is declared an enemy of' the 
conftitution. Foreign powers, fay they, are go- 
ing to fall upon us. 

I will admit they are ; but if, yielding to this 
motive, you fhould forget your principles, your 
dignity, and the conftitution, in order to fee 
nothing but a foreign danger ; in that cafe, haflen 
to tear the conftitution to pieces ; you are no 
longer worthy of it ; you can no longer defend 
any part of it. Do you really think, that if your 
enemies fhould come to enjoin upon you your own 
difgraee ; do you believe that they would Hop at 
this firft ftep ? No ; they would compel you to 
eftablifh the projeft of the two houfes, that hered- 
itary nobility, every where the accomplice and 
fupport of defpotifm : They would force you to 
revive that fatal nobility, on the fide of which, a 
eonftitution cannot be maintained : They would 
force you to reftore to the King a part of his ab- 
folute authority : In fine, to what would they not 
force you ! What would be the boundary of their 
infolent demands, and of your cowardly weak- 
nefs — Dare fix it ! dare fay that, having arrived 
at that boundary, you had rather fight and die, 
than yield. Alas ! fince you cannot avoid, by 
once yielding, either falling back, by degrees into 
flavery, or to be obliged to fight, have now the 
courage to be great, to be refolute, and to be un 
fhaken, at the firft ftep, at the audacious demand. 

The Romans held it for an invariable maxim, 
never to treat with their enemies, till thev had 

' iivl 


laid down their arms ; andlhouldyoube afraid of en- 
emies, who have yet to take them up again ft you ! 
Would you flinch through fear of vain phantoms 1 
But let thofe who are afraid, or who pretend to 
be afraid of thofe phantoms, dare look them in 
the face ; let them try to touch them • let them 
fee what they are, and what you are, and the 
frights will vanifh. 

Who are you ? a free people, and you are 
afraid of a few crowned robbers, and kennels of 
Oaves ! Did Athens and Sparta ever fear the nu- 
merous armies, which the defpots of Peru a drag- 
ged in their fuit ? Did they fay to Miltiades, to 
Cimon, or to Ariftides, receive a King, or you 
will be undone P They would have anfwered, in 
a language worthy of the Greeks, “We fhall fee 
one another at Marathon , at Salamis 

And the French will have alfo their Marathon, 
their Salamis, il there be any powers fooiiih 
^enough to attack them. 

Here, gentlemen, even the numbers are on 
the fide of liberty, and we fliall have to envy the 
Spartans, with the glory which they had, of 
ftruggling with a few heroes, againft a hoft of en- 
emies. Our Thermopyles will always be cov- 
ered with numerous legions. 

France alone contains more armed citizens, 
than all Europe can vomit out againft her, of mer- 
cenary foldiers ; and what citizens ! fuch as will de- 
fend their property, their wives, their children, 
their liberty. With thefe tutelar gods, a people 
is not to be conquered, or they knowhow to 
bury themfelves under the ruins of their country. 

What foldiers of a defpotic government can, 
for a long time ftand out againft the foldiers of 
liberty ? The foldiers of tyrants have more difci- 
E , plinc 


24 


pline than courage, more fear than attachment ; 
they want money ; they are little to be trufted ; 
they defert, the firft opportunity. The foldier of 
liberty tears neither latigues, dangers, hunger, nor 
the want of money ; what he has, he cheerfully 
fpends for the defence of his country ; (for this, I 
call to witnefs the brave foldiers of Civet !) he 
runs, he flies at the cry of liberty, while defpo- 
tifm would, with difficulty, make him take a 
few languid Heps. Let a patriotic army be dd- 
ffroyed, another immediately rifes out of its allies. 
It is becaufe under that liberty, every man is a 
foldier ; men, women, children, miniffers, mag- 
iftrates. Two defeats will deftroy the molt nu- 
merous and befl; difciplined armies of tyrants in 
Europe. Defeats inftruft and irritate, the fold- 
iers ol liberty, and do not diminilh their number. 

O ye, who doubt of the prodigious and fu- 
pernatural efforts, which the love of liberty may 
infpire men to exercife ! Behold what the Amer- 
icans have done, to obtain their independence ! 
See Do£ior Warren, who had never handled a 
mulket, defend with a handful of ill-armed, ill - 
difciplined citizens, the little eminence ot Bun- 
ker-hill ; and before he furrendered, make up- 
wards of twelve hundred Englifn foldiers bite 
the ground Follow General Waihington, mak- 
ing head, with three or four thoufand peafants, 
againft more than thirty thoufand Englifhmeu, 
and fporting with their ftrength. Follow him to 
Trenton ; 1 had it from his own mouth, his fold- 
iers had no fhoes ; the ice, which tore their 
feet, was tinged with their blood : IVe Jkall 

have faces to-morrow , / aid they ; we will beat 
the Engliih — and they did beat them. 

Ah! 

* Mordrc la po* filer c. Tc cat the duff. 


Ah! let the men whodefpair of French valour,, 
who do not believe it capable ol fuftaining the 
combined efforts of hoffile powers, let thofe men 
ceafe to calumniate our regular troops, who r fo 
valiant, when they fought for foreign quarrels, 
will be much more fo, when they fight for their 
own caufe — their liberty. Let them ceafe to ca- 
lumniate our national guards, whofe devotednefs 
is manifefted at this crifis in fo {hiking a manner, 
and who accufe fortune for nothaving yet furnifhed 
them with an opportunity to difplay their valour* 

Athens alone, the little country of Athensr, 
could, for thirteen years together, fulfain the 
efforts of the confederacy of the Spartans, the 
Thebans and of the Perfians ; and never yielded, 
but to number, to fatigues, and to the want o.St 
means. 

England, at the time of the revolution of 
1640, could, to recover her liberty, maintain, 
during ten years, the mofl deftru&ive civil war, 
and gain battles abroad too. 

The Americans, few in number, without diL 
ciplined troops, without ammunition, without 
artillery, without {hips, without money, could 
refill ; and after feven years combat, conquer a na- 
tion brave andrich, and whofe navy knows no equal. 

And, fnould we, having, in the extent of 
France, in our mountains, and our harbours, 
more refources than the Athenians : Should we, 
more happy than the Englifh in 1640, dreaded 
even now, by our neighbours, without fear of 
civil war, mailers of the feditious, united by a 
concord, which, of twenty-five millions of men, 
makes but one family, one lingle army : Should 
we, who, more happy .than the Americans, can 
#op our enemies by ftrong fortifications, by diL 

c ip lined" 


26 


ciplined and numerous armies, by national guards, 
familiarized to fatigues : Should we, for whom 
heaven has, in order to facilitate the tranfition 
from defpotifm to true liberty, referved an im- 
menfe ftore, recovered by the fuperiority of good 
lenfe over fuperftition : Should we, with fo many 
advantages united, fear powers, which, under the 
defpicable reign of defpotifm, we have fo often 
beat ! What ! under this defpotifm, France alone, 
was able to refiftfeven combined powers, and would 
not the love of liberty again produce a miracle 
which has been brought forth by a ridiculous honor ! 

It is true, that if foriegners league together 
and attack us, they may conquer at fir ft, but 
Rome, when attacked by Hannibal fuffered four 
defeats ; fhe did not defpair, nay, fhe triumphed ; 
neither didahe Americans arrive at independence, 
but by numerous defeats. Some cities may be 
taken, I admit it. Our brethren of thofe cities 
will every where find afylums. We will fhare 
with them both our houfes and our tables. The 
children of the martyrs of liberty fhall become 
our own. We will wipe away the tears of their 
widows. Ah ! it is this fweet communion of 
minds and of hearts, which renders the foldier of 
liberty invincible ; and makes him meet death 
with joy : He bequeathes his family to his breth- 
ren, ana not to tyrants, who would thruft away the 
children, after drinking the blood of their fathers. 

Yes, gentlemen, the men who endeavour to 
difcourage us ; to hinder us from being juft, from 
being free, by the fear of foreign powers, nei- 
ther know the ftrength of France, nor the pro- 
digious eftefls of liberty upon the human charac- 
ter, nor the lituation of foreign powers, nor the 
changes winch the Amen can Revolution , which 

that 


27 


that of France, and which the prodigious unfold- 
ing of univerfal reafon have made, and will make 
in the political cabinets, and in the armies of 
Europe. 

Monarchs might formerly enter into leagues 
one againft another, and endeavour to tear each 
other to pieces, in order to fhare the lands and 
the fubje&s of the conquered ; but men are now 
no longer moveable furniture, which one may fo 
eafily difpofe of, without their confent. Thofe 
Kings of former times might perpetuate their 
wars : At this day, it is above the ftrength of all 
the powers to make a long war. Money is the 
finew of it ; and this finew foon fails. Free 
citizens alone can, for their liberty, maintain 
long wars. The great intereft of liberty, the in- 
tereft which is felf-nourilhed, fupplies the room 
of money among them, which is eafily fpent. 
Thus the powers which league together againft a 
free nation, hitve a prodigious chance againft 
themfelves. They have the almoft certainty of 
burying their troops and their treafures, to no 
purpofe, in the country of liberty. The thirty 
years war, with which Holland bought her liber- 
ty, is an eternal lelfon for the tyrants, who would 
attack ours. The molt formidable power of thofe 
times mifcarried, in that open country, which 
nothing defended, befides the valour of its inhab- 
itants : The treafures of the two hemifpheres, 
were fwal lowed up there. Tyrants are acquainted 
with thofe inftru6tive examples, and do not re- 
peat them. They know too well, at this day, 
that, if their caufe is that of all tyrants, ours is 
that of all. nations; and that we can count amongft 
their foldiers and their fubjeHs, almoft as many 
brothers and patrons. 

What* 





£8 


What, then, ou^it now to be their calculation, 
and their end ? It is to hinder the propagation of 
that Declaration of Rights which threatens all 
thrones ; to preferve, as long as pofhble, the de- 
lufions which furround them. Now, is it by fill- 
ing France with their troops, that foreign Kings 
will prevent the contagion of liberty ? Can they 
think that their foldiers will not hear the facred 
fongs ; that they will not be ravifhed with a con- 
ftitution, where all offices are open to all ; where - 
one man is the equal of another ; ought they not 
to fear, left their foldiers, {baking off their chains,, 
fhould imitate the conduct of the Germans in 
America ; left they fhould eniift under the ban- 
ners of liberty ; left they fhould mix with our 
families ; left they fhould come to cultivate our 
fields, which would become theirs ? 

It is not only thofe, who fhould remain with us, 
whom they will have to fear ; but thofe, who, 
being Ielt of an impious and fruitlefs war, will re- 
turn to them. They will naturally make com- 
panions of their own lot, with the lot of French- 
men ; of the perpetuity of their flavery, with the 
equality of others. They will find their lords 
more infolent ; their minifters more oppreffive ; 
their taxes heavier ; and they will revolt. The 
American Revolution brought forth the French 
Revolution . This will be the facred focus, 
whence will proceed the fpark, which will fet on 
fire the nations, whofe mafters ffiall dare come near 
it. Ah, if the Kings of Europe underhand their 
intereft well ; if they are inllru 61 ed by events, they 
will endeavour rather to ftand aloof from France, 
than to have any communication, by attacking 
her. They will endeavour to make their people 
forget the French Conftitution, by treating them 

kindly; 


kindly ; by lightening their taxes, and by giying 
them more liberty. 

W e are arrived at the time, when public opin- 
ion, the opinion of nations, is every where fecretly 
accounted every thing, in the balance of tyrants. 
Thus, when fome fuperficial perfons have advanc- 
ed that the Englifh government could command 
wars at their fancy, they have advanced an error. 

Without doubt England has no longer any 
political liberty ; but fhe flill knows how to make 
her political opinion refpefted ; and the mifcar- 
riage of the war againft Ruflia, is a proof of it. 
If the fleet does not fail, it is becaufe the nation 
does not choofe it ; Are is flill a true fovereign, 
though George, by playing the Comedy of a Re- 
view, has the air of being the only one. 

When, therefore, one would forefee, either th<5 
poflibility of a war, or the confequences which 
inuft refult from it, it is neceflary to confult pub- 
lic opinion, among thofe who are belt acquainted 
with it : The public opinion, in all the countries, 
whofe forces are wanted to be employed againft 
us, is generally in favour of the French conftitu- 
tion, though certain articles in it may be difpleaft- 
ing. Our newfpapers have made, and will make, 
the conqueft, in this refpefl, of the whole world ; 
and the prefs lias chained down the arms of the 
princes of Europe. Would you be farther con- 
vinced how little formidable they ought to appear 
to you ? examine the iituation of their different 
liates. 

Is it England that our pufillanimous politicians 
a're afraid of ? Overloaded with the enormous 
Weight of a debt which every day increafes, the 
vain parade againft Ruflia, and the deftructive 
war in India ; flie has every thing to fear for her. 

felf; 


felf ; the impofibility of clearing her debt; the 
lofs of her pofleflions in the Eaft Indies ; the con- 
teft with Ireland, and the conftant emigration from 
Scotland. Extend her vi&ories, multiply her fhips, 
her debt does not diminilh by it. Give her the 
fickle Nizam, the perjured Mahratta, and the nom- 
inal Emperor for allies in the Indies ; the Eng- 
lifih empire is not really ftrengthened by them ; it 
is only in imagination. Now it is impoflible that 
this dream of imagination fhould continue much 
longer ; that fix thoufand Englifhmen, fhould, 
for a long time, hold in irons twenty millions of 
men, and frighten a hundred million befides. 

There, doubtlefs, is what the Englilh minifter 
fees ; and he will not go to haften his own ruin, 
by declaring a war which his generous nation 
would execrate. Ele would not defire the ruin 
of that nation, by commencing a war which would 
exhauft all the refources of which it has need, 
to maintain an empire held by one thread. 

Is Holland to be dreaded ? An imperious and 
odious woman, a weak and defpifed prince of the 
enflaved States General ! a magifterial, odious 
ariftocracy, two arillocratic factions given to tear 
each other to pieces ; a feditious mob, at the or- 
ders of the prince, no money, no credit, no Ihips, 
no troops ; two bankrupt companies, and a totter- 
ing bank. There is the Dutch government and 
its means. It has, therefore, every thing to fear, 
and cannot be feared. 

Is Pruflia to be feared ? When the inquifition 
is fcated on the throne, it makes it totter, and 
weakens it ; and the King of Pruflia is nothing 
more than a grand inquisitor. When a 
prince is alternately voluptuous and illumined ; 
courageous and weak ; the arbiter of Europe, and 




a* 

the fport of his enemies, that prihee has run his- 
length. It is not that of a conqueror, nor of an. 
able prince ; it is that of a vain man, and of an 
egotift : Liberty is not afraid of fuch adverfaries. 
Add to this the divifion of the miniftry ; an cx- 
baufted treafury ; a difpofition in tlie loldiers to 
defert ; a dread ol the aggrandizement of the: 
houfe of Auftria, which our ruin or our return to. 
the old government would equally favour ; and 
you will find ftrong motives for fcorning Pruflia.^ 
Is it Auftria you fear ? A prudent King eftab- 
lifhes peace in his own dominions, before he un- 
dertakes a foreign war ; Leopold is prudent, 
and pacific, and he is far from having peace in the 
fcattered parts of his own empire. Brabant trem- 
bles at her own chains.; the true V one kijls are tir- 
ed of being fported with ; the dates are not the 
dupes of the perfidious carelFes of the court ; the 
people begin to fee clearly ; they all wait only for 
the firft opportunity to break out. Will Leopold 
fend troops into France, when they fcarcely are 
fufficient to reftrain Brabant, and that unhappy 
country of Liege, which roars at the cruelties of 
its mitred Sultan ? .Will he draw upon himfelf a 
war with twenty five millions of freemen, when,, 
at the fame time, he breaks with the Turks Fie 
wants to keep the Hungarians in fubjeclion, 
whofe unfubduable character, the example of 
Poland flimulates ; when even his own domin- 
ions in Italy conceal a focus of fedition ; in fine, 
when his treafures, fcarcely fufficient for his Or- 
dinary expenfes, will foon be exhauiled by a war 
againll the liberty of a great nation ! ; Leopold 
yields every where, even to fanaticifm,. which he 
abhors ; he feels his own weaknefs ; and what is. 
fe) be feared from a weak and timid prince ?

Shall I fpeak of that Germanic league, whicli 
is but a vain phantom ; of thofe petty dates, 
which have the audacity to conceal our fugitives- 
amongfl them ? If our miniftry had had any idea 
of the dignity of our revolution, one word from 
their mouth would have made thele obfcure ty» 
rants fhrink into nothing ; one fire of whofe can- 
ons, will fet their fubjetts at liberty. . 

Shall I fpeak ol the thunderbolts of Rome ? 
They can. frighten only the fuperftitious ; and it 
is the people themfeives who have broken the idol 
of fuperllition : Rome is no longer to be feared, 
fince the people are become philofophers. 

Shall I arrefl my attention upon the vain brags 
of the Don Quixote of the north ? But he is not 
a Guftavus, and we are not Dalecarlians, nor 
Ruffians. TheNerva does not run through France. 

Shall we be frightened at the motions oi Spain ? 
But the agitations of its King ; the change of her 
minifters ; the partial reformations, which his 
miniflers are attempting ; the prohibition ol our 
publications ; the affembling of the cortez ; the 
formation of a line of troops ; in a word, do not 
all thefe movements rather prove the terrors than 
the hofiile projetts of the King of Spain ? Fright- 
ed to death, as well as all other fovereigns, he is 
in agitation to ward off the blow ; and though his 
treasures f-hould not be exhaufled ; though he 
fhould have Some credit, armies and provifions, 
the difpofition of minds is fuch, and he knows it, 
that to give the Signal to pafs over the Pyrenees, 
is to call liberty into his kingdom. 

In fine, is it the King of Sardinia, who, with a . 
few thoufand men, whom he parades in his own 
dominions, throws our profound politicians into 
convuifions ? But can millions of Frenchmen be 

afraid 



m 


* 


afraid of a prince, to whom a handful of fchool 
boys has lately given law in his own capital ? 

From thefe piHures, what refults ? That all 
foreign powers have effe&s to fear from the 
French revolution ; that France has nothing to 
fear from them. Hence it follows that thefe pow- 
ers will confine themfelves to fright us with bug- 
bears ; but they will never realize their threats. 
And Ihould they realize them, it is not like a 
Frenchman to be afraid of them ; it would be 
worthy of us to prevent them. Ah ! thefe fears 
would long ago have been qualhed, if our minif- 
try had been compofed of patriots ; or if the Na- 
tional Alfembly had refolved to take a determi- 
nate attitude, in the face of all the powers of Eu- 
rope. The Stadtholder of Holland had the au- 
dacity to thereaten the long Parliament of Eng- 
land, and this Parliament immediately declared 
againft him.. Louis XIV, and Mazarin, afforded 
refuge to the fon cjf Charles I. The Parliament 
ordered it to be notified to the haughty monarch, to 
drive Charles out of his dominions ; the fupple 
Mazarin obeyed. Obferve that this Parliament, 
which even braved foreign powers, had to fubmit 
in its own country to Scotland and Ireland, when, 
they rebelled ; that it had but forty or fifty thou- 
fand foldiers at its command : And we have three, 
millions of citizen foldiers. The foreigners were- 
atraid oi them, and will be afraid of us, if France 
will finally take a tone, becoming juft and free 
men, in the face of the tyrants, whom our filence 
alone emboldens ; then our fugitives will difap- 
pear from their dominions, and the mind will no 
longer be alarmed by falfe fears. 

Our true enemfcs, gentlemen, am^aot foreigners, 
but truly thofe who maf#« uf£ their name to 

frighten 


frighten people ; our enemies arc thole, who 
though detefted, yet coalefce, in order to difgrace 
the nation, and difunite it, by reeftablilhing a 
government without confidence; and of which 
they hope to be mailers ; bur enemies are thofe 
who, after having with regret, eftablilhed the bill 
of rights, annul all thofe rights one after another 
by bye-laws ; our enemies are thofe who, after 
having declared the fovereignty of \ the nation ef- 
tablifh above it another fovereign under the title 
oi Inviolable - our enemies are thofe who would 
preferve to the Supreme Executive, a frightful civil 
lift, and who look upon corruption as a necelfary 
element of our government ; our enemies, in fine, 
are thofe who fay to us, forget the treafon, or elfe 
be afraid of foreigners. 

A Frenchman, to be determined by the fear of 
foreigners ! Liberty is no more, when people liften 
to tliefe fears ; and he muft be either a cowardly 
or a miferable citizen who ft^ites them to his ai- 
fiftance. I therefore make this exprefs motion, 
that every individual, who fhall oppofe the fear of
