INTRODUCTION. 


HE following fheets are the fubftance of 


two fpeeches delivered by the Author 
in the Jacobin Club of Paris on the 2d and 
1 9th of May : they were intended as anfwers 
to a famous Addrefs of Briffot’s to his Confti- 
tuents, in which he accufes the Jacobin Club 
of being the authors of the misfortunes and 
difbrders of France. 

It was in confequence of the following 
Pamphlet, that the Municipality of Paris, and 
Jacobin Club, preicntcd to the Conven- 
tion their famous petition againfl the Briffotin 
Faftion, as they termed it, when tlicic two bo- 
dies, and the armed force of Paris, fixrrounded 
the hall of the Affembly, and forced the Con- 
vention to declare traitors to their country the 
majority of that very Convention ; by which 
means they firmly fixed the defpotic power of 
the city of Paris over every other part of the 
empire, and brought about the third Revolu- 
tion in four years, that of the 3 iftof May 1793.

outlawry, and feventy-five in a ftate of accu- 
fation, where accufation is condemnation ; all 
theft events the effeCts of the following pages 
give them a confequence, they are neither en- 
titled to from their matter or their ftyle. — 
The tranflator has endeavoured to copy the 
Author’s ftile with his thoughts, and give to 
his readers a fpecimen of that coarfe and fal- 
lacious eloquence, with which theft bloody 
men promulgate their murdering principles ; 
if therefore from a defire to follow too cloftly 
the ftnfe and manner of his Author, he un- 
avoidably deviates into gallicifms* and. an in- 
correct mode of writing, he trufts to the 
candour of the public to excufe the errors on 
account of the motives. — He was chiefly in- 
duced to this undertaking from adefireof {hew- 
ing, that all the aCtors which have been conti- 
nually drifting on the horrid theatre of France, 
each in their turns have ^employed the fame 
means of profcription, affafii nation, and tu- 
mult, to obtain their ends, fome openly, fomO 
with affeCled horror, and that fooner or later 
each drinks the bitter cup of outrage and 
death he adminiftered to others.

THE

OF THE 

BRISSOTINS. 


T HOSE furely were to be envied who were 
elected Deputies of the Convention. Did 
there ever exift fo noble a million ? fuch a favor- 
able opportunity of acquiring glory ? the heir 
of fixty-five Defpots, the Jupiter of Kings, 
Louis XVI. become a prifoner of the nation, 
and brought before the avenging fword of juf- 
tice; the ruins of fo many , palaces and caltles;

terials in our hands, with which to build the 
C.onlHiuti.on i 90,000 Pmfiians,, or Auftrians, 
flopped by 17,000 Frenchmen ; the whole na- 
tion arifen to exterminate them : Heaven itfelf 
Uniting with our arms, and fending duxes as 
auxiliaries to our cannons : the King of Pruffia 
reduced to lefs than 40,000 effective men, pur- 
fued and furrounded by a vi&orious army of 
110,000 men. — Belgia, Holland, Savoy, Great 
Britain,. Ireland, a great part of Germany,, all 
pre fling forward to meet Liberty, and publicly 
offering up vows for our fuccefs. Such was the 
date of affairs at the opening of the Convention. 
—To create the French Republic ; to diforga- 
nize Europe ; perhaps to purge it of its tyrants 
by the irruption of the volcanic principles of 
equality.— Paris,, not merely a. department, but 
the hofpitable and common city of every citizen 
of every department. Paris (which only fub- 
fifled by the monarchy, and which, however, 
has-xresated the Republic) to indemnify for her 
Ioffes, by placing-her. between the mouths of the 
Rhineandthe Rhone, and giving Ker.a maritime

by the public diappinefs, and above .all, to re- 
eftablilh .the people (who, till our days, were 
reckoned as nothing, and whom Plato in his 
Republic, although only an imaginary one, had 
devoted to flavery) in their primitive rights, and 
to recall them to equality. Such was tire fu- 
blime vocation of the deputies of the Conven- 
tion. — What .foul fo cold and narrow, but what 
would have been on fire, and expanded in con- 
templating fuch glorious deftinies ? Who has pre- 
vented our fulfilling this talk of glory ! In which 
party are the enemies of the Republic, the fac- 
tious, the true lovers of anarchy, the confpira- 
tors, the accomplices of JDumourier, of Pitt, 
and of Pruftia ? 

It is at laft time to point them out, and do 
them juft ice, and in the volume of fads I am 
about to. colled. againft them, I fhall have drawn 
up their indidments for the departments, and 
for Jhiftory , I fhall have before-hand pronounced 
the univerfal opinion of posterity* 

A few days fince Pethion uttered his groans in 
thefe terms to the Convention : “ of what ufe 
is it to us to refute a (lander — to-day funk to the 
bottom, to-morrow it fwims on the fervice ; 
refuted at the tribune, and driven from every 
B 2 mind. 


( 4 ) 

mind, the next day it again appears in the pub- 
lic prints, and is hawked in every ftreet. When 
then will they commit to writing, and not to 
the winds, their accufations againft us, that we 
Inay anlwer article >by article ?” — You fhall be 
gratified, Pethion, you and yours; I will fet 
down the accufations againft you, and I am cu- 
rious to hear how you will anfwer my examina- 
tion on fads. 

• But in the firft place one preliminary obferva- 
iion is- indifpenfable.-^— There is little candor, 
in afking from us fads which prove confpiracy. 
The only trace which memory yet preferves of 
the famous orations, of Briflot and Genfonne, 
in which they attempted to prove the exiftence 
of the Auftrian Committee, is the principle 
they had laid down. That in confpiracies, it is 
abfurd to call for demonftrative fads andjudi- 
cial proofs : that in no time have they ever 
been obtained, not even in the confpiracies of 
Cat aline ; for confpirators are not ufed to be fo 
unguarded in their condud. It is fufficient that 
there exifts ftrong probabilities :-r— if fo, then 
will I prove againft Briflot and Genfonne the 
exiftence of an Anglo-Prufiian committee, by a 
colledion of probabilities, a hundred times 
ftronger than thofe by which Briflot and Gen r 
... x .... fo.nne 


( 5 ) 

fonne proved the exiftence of an Auftrian Com- 
mittee. 

I eftablifti it as a fad, that the right fide of 
the Convention, and principally their leaders, 
are almoft all partizans of royalty, accomplices in 
the treafon of Dumourier and Bournonville ; that 
they are direded by the agents of Pitt, Orleans, 
and Pruffia ; that they wanted to divide or rather 
overturn France into twenty or thirty federative 
republics, that no republic might exift. I main- 
tain that no hiftory can furnifh an example of a 
confpiracy more clearly proved, and by fuch a 
multiplicity of ftrong prefumptive proofs, than 
the confpiracy of thofe whom I call Bri ffo tins, 
(becaufe Briflot was the foul of it) againft the 
French republic. 

But I will go back to the firft formation of 
this confpiracy. Nobody will at this time deny 
that in our revolution of 1789, Pitt did not 
wifh to make Louis XVI. repay the bill of ex- 
change drawn by cardinal Richelieu on Charles 
the Firft, in 1641. Every one knows the part 

that cardinal aded in the divifions of the long 
parliament, when he penfioned the moft zealous 
republicans of that day. Many things have 
fince recalled to my mind the rage of Briffbt, 
when, near three years ago, an ariftocratic news 

writer, 

O

miter, who had difcovered the accounts of ,the 
fecret expences of Mazain and Richelieu, found 
in fhillings, pence and farthings, the Turns which 
tfhafe minifters had paid $& Fiennes .and Hamp- 
den,, for .their zeal in calling for .a .republic. 
Tfeofe who read the Patriot Fxancais, may xe- 
fuember -with how much warmth Rriffot fear- 
ing jhe application of that fa& to himfdf, be- 
jeame thedhampion of the dihnterefted purity of 
the Englilh republicans. 

Befides this, Pitt wifhed to take his revenge 
for the fuc cours accorded ,by V.ergennes to .the 
Junglifli American infurgeats- But to the great 
mortihcation .both of Pitt and Briffot, it has been 
difcovered that they have carried liberty beyond 
what was agreeable or convenient to England r! 
and Pitt and BrifTot have both exerted them- 
/elves ,to check it. When general Dillon afferted 
near four years hnce, in the Tribune of the 
Conftituent Affembly., that he knew for certain 
that Briffot was the emiiTary of Pitt, and found- 
ed his horn as he directed $ few people minded 
him, for Dillon was an arihocrate y but thofe who 
have followed the marches and counter-marches 
of Briffot, frooi the time of his writings on the 
colonies and the ilave trade, till the evacuation 
of Holland and the Low -Countries, mull allow, 
that in that immenfe number of volumes a

Wiilany one contradict me; in what I* proved 
in a fpeech which the Jacobim Society ffilli re- 
members, and which I fpoke on the political 
fete* of the nation at die opening of tlieleghla- 
tive affembly; that our revolution of vf&y was 
a piece of bufinefs arranged between the Ehgliili 
miniftry and a part of the minority' of the 
nobleife, prepared by fome in' the hopes of turn- 
ing- out the adhocracy of Verlailles", and thereby' 
to poffefs themfelves of their cables, houfesramf 
offices ; by others to faddleus with a new mailer^; 
and by all, in order to give us two houfes and a 
oonftitution like that of England! When 5 I 
made this fpeechdo the fociefy, on the 21ft of 
08 :ober, 1789; in which F (Hewed that the roots' 
of the revolution were ariilbcrratic ones- when - '

of Sillery and Voidefj yet 1 / but gently touched

neceflfary to compleat the: revolution before* its 
Hi (lory was written. I only wiflied to hint to’

that He fhould 1 not imagine thatirt our vilfe tb

him the harp of his wife, and the more forcible 
allurements of his fyrens, had fo engaged my 
attention, that my eyes and ears employed alone 
in admiration, did not allow time to my obferving 
mind to follow all his operations, and to fketch 
his plans of a republic. 

Will any one endeavour to make me believe, 
-that when on the 12th of July 1789, I got on 
a table, and excited the people to liberty — that 
it was my perfualive eloquence which half an 
hour afterwards occafioned that general commo- 
tion ; that at my voice, the bulls of Or- 
leans and Neckar fuddenly Halted from under 
ground. 

Do they imagine, that in the fifteen days I 
dwelt with Mirabeau previous to the 6th of 
O&ober, on which day I quitted him, I took no 
heed of all the meafures which forerun the day 
from the fifth to the fixth ?— Do they imagine, 
that when I went to Mirabeau in the very inflant 
when he learnt that Orleans was fet off for Lon-^ 
don, that his anger at feeing himfelf deferted, 
and his imprecations worthy of Philo&etes, and 
thofe of his Secretary, and the petrified air of 
Servan, and in that very tirrie his conne&ions 
with the Englifhman Dumont, and the Ge- 
nevois Durouveray, and their journey back- 
wards 


( 9 ) 

wards and forwards from Paris to London, gave 
rife to no conjedures in my mind. 

Is it not a fad, that BrifTot was the Secretary 
of Madame Sillery, or, if not hers, of her bro- 
ther de Crefls ? * Is it not a fad, that BrifTot 
and Laclos (for Danton would not accede to it) 
were the unpunifhed authors of the fatal [pe- 
tition of the Champ de Mars, concerted with 
La Fayette,-}* BrifTot and Laclos, that is to fay, 
Orleans and La Fayette. — The reader, who is not 
perfedly acquainted with the prefent date of af- 
fairs will be aflonifhed to fee thefe two names 
coupled together. Have patience till I have 
unravelled the intrigue, and all furprize will be 
at an end. 

Is it not a fad, that Pethion made a journey 
to London in the fame carriage with Madame 
Sillery, Mademoifelle Orleans, Pamela, and Ser- 
cey, who may be called the three graces, and 
who clofely prefTed his virtuous and luckily cold 

# Chancellor of the Duke of Orleans. 

t This was a petition to the Aflembl y to depofo the King-, 
and eftablifh a Republic, when his Majefty was brought 
back prifoner from Varennes. By the orders of the AfTem» 
bly, and thofe of the Municipality, M. de la Fayette di£» 
perfed the mob, but it was neceflary to order the national 
militia of Paris to fire on them, by which near 20 perfons 
were killed.

chafte knee 5 and on his return was he not elected 
mayor of Paris, and why this fufpicious jour- 
ney ? What important negociation made it ne- 
CefTary, that fo great a man as Jerome Pethion 
fhould pafs the fea, and confult with Pitt ? 

Does Pethion think I have forgot the dinners 
Sillery invited me to in the apartment of Apollo 
three years ago, when they thought I might be 
of fofne ufe to them. The other guefts were 
Pethion, Voidel, Volney, Mirabeau, Barrere, 
the tutor of Pamela, and other Republicans of 
the fame manufa&ory ; but Robefpierre, was 
never afked. 

You then was alfo one of the fa&ion of Or- 
leans ? I hear Barbaroux exclaim to me on ac- 
count of thefe dinners; but I anfwer him, that 
in the early dawn of the revolution, this coali- 
tion was fo connected with the real friends of li- 
berty and the republic, that it would have been 
the excefs of flupidity to have fired upon our 
troops by joining with the Abbe Maury or Bou- 
cher D’Argis. — In the month of July 1789, the 
number of Republicans in Paris did not proba- 
bly exceed ten; and this it is, which crowns 
with eternal glory, thofe old members of the 
club of the Cordeliers, who began building the 
edifice of the republic with fuch flight materials. 

When 


( 11 y 

When one recolle&s, that it was fuch a man as 
Chapelier who laid the firft ftone of the Jacobin 
club ; when fuch was the baftardized fource of 
our regeneration, every one mufl be fenfible, 
that to call the ftatue of our idol, liberty, we 
were obliged to follow the example of that cu- 
rate, who made his filver image of the virgin 
out of melted chamber-pots.— Wliat aflifted us 
moft marveloufly was this : the neceflity which 
ah thefe intriguers were under of courting po- 
pular favour, in order that they might make 
themfelves confpicuous to the intendant La- 
porte,* and by firft obtaining the confidence of 
the people, obtain a larger portion of the civil lift. 
They began by attacking the court with fo 
much the more violence, as they hoped to fell 
themfelves proportionably dear : it was thus 
that we were enabled to give battle to the vete- 
rans, who deferted us by the new levee of in- 
triguers who daily flocked to the Jacobins ftand- 
ard : it was by thefe means that the Chapelier, 
the Dumetz, and the Defmeuniers, were driven 
from the club, by the Barnaves and Duports ; 
and the Barnaves and Duports by the Briflots 
and the Rolands. It was thus that we van- 
quifhed the pure and unqualified defpotifm of 
Calonne, by the two legiflative houfes of Neckar ; 

* The King ’ s trea l* ure r of the civil lift, beheaded fhortly 
after the 10th of Auguft.

and the two legiflative houfes of Neckar, 
by the two legiflative fedtions of BrifTot, Pe- 
thion, and Buzot ; and the adtive citizens of 
Syezes and Condorcet, by what we at lafl ar- 
rived at, the fans culottes. It was thus that we 
fucceflively vanquifhed Maury the royalift, by 
Mounier and his two houfes ; Mounier and his 
two houfes by Mirabeau, with his abfolute ne- 
gative and Mirabeau’s abfolute negative by 
Barnave’s fufpenfive veto ; and Barnave and his 
fufpenfive veto by BrifTot, who chofe to admit 
of no other negative than that of himfelf and 
his friends. All thefe rogues fwept by each 
other from the jacobins, have at lafl made room 
for Danton, Robefpierre, and Lindet, for thofe 
general deputies of every department, moun- 
taineers of the Convention ; the bulwarks of the 
republic, whofe thoughts have never wandered 
a moment from their objedi ; the political and in- 
dividual liberty of every citizen, a conflitution 
worthy of Solon and Lycurgus, one indivifible 
republic ; the fplendour and pfofperity of France, 
not an impradticable equality of property, but 
an equality of rights and happinefs. It is thus 
that Neckar, Orleans, La Fayette, Chapelier, 
Mirabeau, Bailly, Defmeuniers, Duport, Lamet- 
te, Paftoret, Cerutti, BrifTot, Ramond, Pethion, 
4Suadet, Genfbnne, have been the impure vafes 
of Amafis, from which ip the mould of the jaco- 
bin club has been cafi; the golden ftatue of the 

Re- 


Republic. Till our days, it has been thought 
with the legiflators of old, that virtues were the 
neeeffary bafis of a Republic, the eternal glory 
of the jacobin club will be to have formed one 
from vices. 

The reader has already perceived that Neckar, 
Orleans., La Fayette, Malouet, Chapelier, Dan- 
dre,Defmeuniers, Mirabeau, Duport, Barnave 
Dumolard, Ramond, Dumourier, Roland, Ser- 
van, Claviere, Guadet, Genfonne, Louvet, 
Petion, P/TT, Briffot, Sillery, are only links of 
the fame chain. They are the fame ferpent cut 
into different parts, continually reuniting to hifs 
and threaten the popular tribunes, the Jacobins, 
the People, Equality, and the Republic. I have 
already placed my finger on the joint which 
united Briffot and Orleans 

-I fhall 

* Thus far die popular leaders of the conflituent af- 
fembly. 

f Remark that I do not here immediately mean Philip 
Egalite, of whom, as an individual, I will fpeak my opinion 
prefently, But rather of the atmofphere of intrigues and po- 
litics, in which he moved and by which he was hurried on. 
I mean thofe who compofed his council, Ducreft, Salles, 
Limon, Briffot, with the cotterie of Mad. de Sillery, Genlis, 
whofe itch for notoriety was continually increafing in de- 
pravity, who forfook that very natural defire of being the 
mother of princely baltards, and of mufick, for that of 

snaking 


I 14 ) 

I fhall finifli this irrefiflible collection of 
proofs by proving what will aftonifh the world, 
that Bri-ffot, Pethion, and their gang, were only 
the continuers of Orleans’s fadtion. 


As Sillery had for a long time fufpe&ed me, 
I was no longer invited to dinner, I therefore 
could not continue my obfervations in that 
place. Gorfas and Carra filled my place in the 
hall of Apollo.— When I faw that Louvet had 
fucceeded to the favour I once enjoyed, and that 
Sillery never quitted his fide at the Jacobin club, 
where he was his molt zealous champion : When 
I faw Sillery in the debate on the war, take fo 
warmly the part of Briffot and Louvet, that I 
could not decide whether Sillery efpoufed their 
quarrels againfl Robefpierre, or rather whether 
it was not they who fought the battles of Phillip 
and of Sillery againfl Robefpierre, too true a repub- 
lican for their purpofes. If I had not remarked 
the indifcretion of Carra, who, devoid of all 
lhame, now about a year fince, propofed at the 


making books ; and that of being the authorefs of comedies 
for that of becoming a dodor of Sorbonne ; and the calm 
delights of devotion ; of a contemplative life, and of being 
a monk, for the pleafures of an adive life, intermeddling in 
politics; of becoming fuperintendant and mini Her, when Ihe

Jacobin Club, to make the duke of York, or 
fome other prince of the lioufe of Brunfwick, 
king of France, and who, as a preliminary, was to 
have married madamoifelle Orleans. If I had 
not remarked the choice made by the prefident, 
Pethion, of Carra, as a companion to Sillery, 
when he was fent to the camp of La Lune to ob- 
ferve the conduct of Dumourier, and to aflift 
at his conferences with the king of Pruflia’s aid- 
de-camp, Mansfield ; yet fiiould I have found 
out the amphytion Sillery, by the ceafelefs en- 
deavours of the three journalifts* to blacken the 
characters of Danton and Robefpierre ; and here 
is the place for me to make an effential obfer- 
vation. ‘ 

One of the manoeuvres which our enemies 
have the moft fuccefsfully employed in this re- 
volution, has been the provident care with which, 
they have magnified to Colofial greatnefs the 
reputations of fome men, and deftroyed that of 
others. Ariftocracy has always taken care to 
provide a referve of knaves. Doubtful of the 
fuccefs of her principal aCters, all her arts were 
employed in preparing a reputation for the one 
who was to fucceed him, whenever he thould be 
hifled from the fcene. Thus, when they feared

that

that Mirabeau, atid after him Barnave, whofe re- 
putation began to wear out, could not long main- 
tain themfelves in their polls ; a vafl packet of 
reputation for patriotifm, was hafhily colleded 
for Pethion and Briffot, that they might re- 
place them : and after them, Roland, who hakfd* 
falfely calumniated the commons of Paris, ih 
whofe name I thus take upon me thus to ad- 
drefs them *. 

For a long time your only projed has been 
that of dominion. It was indifferent to you, whe- 
ther the tools of your ambition were kings, gene- 
rals, or lacqueys, provided it was not the people. 
You have always inveterately maintained and 
proteded every thing which was by its very na- 
ture oppofed to a popular and republican fpirit. 
Shew me by what ads, by what fpeeches, you 
have clearly manifefted your love of the people. 
You have fometimes domineered over the people, 
nay, fometimes you have affeded to carefs them ; 
but even your careffes bore fuch marks of arifto- 
cratic haughtinefs and repugnance;, that there 
was no miflaking them. 

* Owing to fome falfe printing in the original, there is a 
hiatus in the fenfe, which the tranflator has been obliged to 
fill up. 


Your 


Your fyftem of eftablifhing a patrician order 
for your low colleagues, broke out in all your 
words and writings ; you would never mix with 
the people ; in one word, this is your doc- 
trine ! According to that, the people are of no 
other ufe than as the means of neceflary infur- 
redion ; after having ferved to effed a revolu- 
tion, they are to return to the dull, and are no 
more to be thought of : they are to allow them- 
felves to be conducted by thofe who are wifer 
than themfelves, and who are willing to take the 
pains of governing them ! your whole conduct is 
chalked out on thefe criminal principles. 

In the month of June and July 1792, when 
the cunning of the court, and the obflinacy of 
Briflot, had kindled a cruel and fatal war a- 
mongft the jacobins ; we true jacobins who fore- 
faw the approaching ftorm from the royal party, 
who felt the dangerous confequences of the an- 
ger with which our colleagues were animated 
againft Briflot and his party, endeavoured at a 
reconciliation ; we even propofed it, and our 
fincerity was confpicuous. “ We faid to you, 
Briflot, let us unite to free gurfelves from the 
tyrants', and if then you are dill fufceptible of 
hatred, we will try each others power,” 


( *« ) 

I afiert# that you refuted the pe^de prof- 
fered to you by the people. I mean by that, 
that you deceived the people $ that you only 
entered into a truce which was advantageous to 
yourfelf ; I above others, importuned you for 

weel^s, in order to obtain this reconciliation. 
Yatt BrifTot, and above all, you Pethion, con* 
ftantly received us haughtily, fulkily, and coldly $ 
yott pever could conceal that hatred with which 
pur very prefenee infpired you. You ftretched 
cut a finger to m, but never the hand. — -You 
did not eVen fh ink it fiecefiary to refute 
yourfelves the gratifications which haughty 
minds derive from treating others with infqlence? 
and contempt : I call Danton to bear witnefs to 
theft truths. He who would have given you 
tip \o the cpnfequences of your imprudence#

And here is a proper place for mentioning 
the negociation which Genfonne and Guadet 
entered into with the court by the means of 
Boze and Thyefy.* 

Was it not yOU Briflot, and your friends, 
who retarded the revolution of the iotli of 
Auguft ? Oh the following days of the nth, 
t2th, 13th, and 14th, had you once employed 
yourfelves in couiitera6ting the treafons of La 
Fayette; the approach of the PrulSans ; the 
total want of arms and provifions ; the lofs of 
Longwi, and the plunder Of our frontiers ? To 
Danton, criminal in your eyes from his fen 
vices, and dteadful from his popularity, you 
left the talk of appearing the ftorm. — >You were 
folely employed in watching the council of the 
Commons of Paris.— That was yOur medufa, 
youf hydra, yOur terror, driven on by them the 
triumphal Car of the people proceeded with noife 
and rapidity, and crulhed the ruins of the throne 
beneath its wheels. You equally dreaded the 
intire deftfudtion of that throne, and the force 
that caufed it.— Who has not feen you agi- 
tated, alarmed at every trifling refolution of 
thefe revolutionary Commons. In your defpair, 
Roland and Claviere could devife no other ex-

Was it not you, BrifTot, and your friends, who 
furrounded the tyrant when in chains, with all 
thofe exterioir appearances, which in his dif- 
graceful fituation could yet elevate him above 
other men ? — Did 1 not above all fee you, BrifTot, 
running about affeding to feek palaces for his 
refidence, to deceive him with a fhew of zeal, 
and at lafl fixing on a gaol, in hopes to reduce 
him to accept the capitulation, you did not yet 
defpair of obtaining from him ? When you were 
endeavouring to calumniate the Commons of 
Paris, did you not inform the tyrant; that you 
detefied his indefatigable goalers,to whom never- 
thelefs you left the care of your hoflage ? — 
When you deprived the Commons of fo many 
functions, why did you difgrace them by flill 
charging them with the guard of the defpot, 
if it was not to profit equally by the fafe impri- 
fonment and gratitude of your captive? what 
have you left untried to arrive at the double 
purpofe of preferving the life of the tyrant : By 
forwarding his trial ; but at the fame time attri- 
buting his judgment to the Convention whom 
you hoped to dired ; by your faving from the

the execution of their proje&s, but the refiflance 
of republicans and men of the people. Even 
before our indignation burfl forth againfl them, 
they began attacking and flandering us ; they 
called us agitators* becaufe, in truth, nothing 
more violently agitates a true patriot than per-

We were the corruptors, and yet they

to the right and the left? I was told this by 
citizen Meaulle, who has already announced to 
the Convention, that he will explain himfelf fur-? 
ther on this atrocious plot* 

Did not Guadet fo openly avow his private 
difpofition towards Pruffia, as one day to fay in 
the committe, “ what does it frgnify to us, whe- 
ther Dutch cheefe merchants are freemen or 
flaves ?” this very Mr. Guadet, who fix months 
before pofitively called for war, that he might 
municipalize Europe ? Did I not hear Briffot, who 
alfo wifhed for a war, that he might municipalize 
Europe, publicly rejoice at the former committee 
of general defence in the misfortunes of our Bel- 
gian army, faying, “ that the evacuation of Hol- 
land and Belgia was a fortunate event, as it 
might lead to a peace.’’ 

What man fo dull-fighted, who, on remarking 
the frequent conferences between Dumourier 
and the aid-de-camp Mansfield, in the neighbour- 
hood, and under the aufpices of Carra and Sil- 
lery, but mull have remembered, that Carra, 
from all eternity, recommended an alliance with 
Pruffia. — Who has forgot Carras’s gold fnuff- 
box with the King of Pruffia’s pi&ure on it ? 


Is 


( 3 ° ) 

Is it not an incomprehenfible thing, and with- 
out example in hiflory, as I told Dumourier my- 
felf, in the midft of his triumph, when he ap-« 
peared before the Convention : that a general 
who with 17,000 men, had held in check an 
army of 92,000, and after having together with 
Aga, Bournonville and Kellerman announced, 
that the plains of Champagne were about to 
become the grave of the Pruffian army, as they 
had been that of Attila’s, that not a fingle man 
fhould efcape ; found it impoffible to cut off the 
retreat of that army, when it was reduced to 
half its numbers by fiuxes, when its march was 
embarraffied by 20,000 tick ; and on the other 
hand, the vi&orious army had augmented "from 
17, to 100,000 men. Every foldier of our ad- 
vanced guard will tell you, that when the rear 
guard of the Pruffian army halted, we alfo 
halted ; that when they moved to the right, we 
marched to the left. In a word, Dumourier ra- 
ther re-conduded the Xing of Pruffia, than pur- 
fued him. There was not a hngle foldier in the 
army, who was not convinced that fome ar- 
rangement had taken place by the means of Du- 
mourier between the Pruffians and the Conven- 
tion. He .certainly did not treat with the 
King of Pruffia, without at lead the confent of 
the diplomatic committee, and thefe Anglor 
Pruffian intriguers j who, delighted with the ef- 
cape

cape of Frederic-William, inftead of calling the 
general to an account for his conduct, employed 
themfelves in bellowing on Fabius, Metullus, 
Dumourier, the honours of an oration. 

Is it not the intimacy of Dumourier, and his 
frequent fecret confultations with the leaders of 
the BrifTotins, a fad, a notorious fad ? Guadet 
fays, that he faw Dumourier at the opera with 
Danton. It was very natural that Dumourier 
ihould affed to appear in public with Danton 5 
but one does not confpire at the opera, it is after 
the opera. It is then that the public might fee

fhew what kind of confidence one is to place in the affertions 
of Briffot.*— He fays in the 2d page of his apology, 1 defy

that that letter was Briffoted * through the zeal

Was a republican, and Marat a royalift ? 

Was it not clear even to the tribunes*, that 
from the month of September, a great part of 
the Convention were royalifts ; the decree abo- • 
lifhing royalty proves nothing. It was a fen*< 
tence of death pronounced againft a malefa&or 
fix weeks after his execution. The greater 
number of thofe who compofed the conftituent 
and legillative affemblies, ill difguifed the an- 
ger they felt at feeing their work deftroyed by j 
the republicans of the Convention. Their love 
of royalty appeared in their imprecations againft 
Paris. La Source, the lead; corrupted of thofe 
who voted with the left, and dined with the

found very many proofs that he kept in his pay 
a flying camp of orators to give battle on the 
terrace of the Thuilleries, at the coffee-houfes 
of Beauquefne and Procope, and in every other 
place where they could meet with them, to thofe, , 
whom they called the champions of Robef-

in the committee of 25, to feize on them, le-

not one which will be an eternal blot. on the ma^

their being accomplices, at lead, that they were

public, will be like the winds, which alfail a 
vigorous tree j their moft violent gulls only 
ftrengthen its roots. The evil was in our blood 
but the eruption of its venom, by the emigration 
of Dumourier, and his lieutenants, has already 
half faved our body politic. The amputations of 
the revoke, ionary tribunal, (not that of a fervant

feen a people condemn their legiflators, to make laws like a

but thole of generals and traitor minifters, with 
the expullion of the Briflbtins' from the Conven- 
tion, will completely infure a found confdtution 
to the Convention. Already 365 members have, 
in the perfonof Louis XVI. executed all kings, in 
£fhgy, and more than 250 members glory in belong- 
ing to the Mountain. Let them cite to me an ex- 
ample in the hiftory of the whole world, of any na- 
tion which ever poffeffed fo many reprefentatives 
truly devoted to her interefts, For fix hundred 
years, the Englilh have had a Parliament, and yet 
only onee have they poffeffed (and that in the 
long Parliament) a Mountain*, and a number of 
true patriots ; and the number of thofe true pa- 
triots, who brought about fuch events, did not 
exceed 1 00 members. In Rome, only Cato ; in 
Holland, only Barnevelt and the two De Wits, 
Ilruggled again!! the genius and the victories of 
Csfar and of William. 

Let us lofe no time in opening the primary 
fchools : it is one of the crimes of the Conven- 
tion, that they are not yet eftab'lifhed. If a 
national inllru&or had been feated in the pul-

Royalty.

is one, however, amongft the ancients to wliofe 
wifcfom we fhould have recourfe. It is Solon,, 
the lawgiver of Athens ; a number of wliofe 
inftitutions appear calculated to take root 
aniongd us. Indeed, it iliould feem as if he 
had the French in contemplation when he framed 
his laws. Montefquieu exclaimed with ad- 
miration in reading the Athenian mode of taxa- 
tion. In that city, he who only poffefled the 
common neceifaries of life paid his contribution 
to the Hate, by his perfon, either by ferving in the 
armies, or attending the pari ih meetings * * but 
the man, whofe fortune amounted to ten 
talents, fupplied his country with a galley ; if 

not from averfion, but from diffidence, and fent his proxy 
to adore the new lights— of their own philofopher, who have 
co-operated with their countrymen — the catalogue is longer. 
Bailli, guillotined for obeying the orders of the ConMtuent

popular murders. Condorcet, condemned to death (though 
not yet taken) for beirg a Briifotin, although he took part 
‘with the Septembrizers, and voted t’pat the king fhould be 
fent to the gallies. The Due de la Rochefaucault, murdered 
by the people at the inftigation of his tutor, and dependent 
Condorcet. Champfort, who murdered himfelf to avoid the 
guillotine— after this treatment of modern philcfrpkcs, they 
do well to have recourfe to ancient philoiophers. 

* The Convention have adopted, this idea, by decreeing 
that all citizens who give up a day’s labour to the important 
duties of political debates in their fedlion, fhall receive 4 a

pofietted of twenty talents, with two ; and if 
matter of thirty with three galleys. Never- 
thelefs, to encourage commerce, however great 
the fortune one had acquired, if one was aBeau- 
jon, or a Laborde *, the law could only exad & 
tax equal to the maintenance of tnree galleys, 
and a fmall Veffel.— ' To indemnify the rich, they 
poiTeffed a proportionable degree of confedera- 
tion in their tribes, were ele&ed to places in the 
municipality, and covered with honours. 

In Athens, there was a treafury for paying the 
expences of the theatres, and indemnifying the 
national comedians for the feats of poor citi- 
zens. Their play-houfes were their primary 
fchools ; but certainly inferior to our colleges of 
arts and trades, when the Convention fhallliave 
eftablifhed them. 

There, no man was exempt from ferving in 
perfon in the war, unlefs he equipped and main- 
tained, at his expence, a foldier and hishorfe, by 
which means the army was not only fupplied 
with an excellent cavalry, but the camp and 
army were not embarraffed with a number of

There, thofe of the fame tribe, and of the! 
fame diftridd, were formed into the fame com- 
pany or fquadron ; they marched, they fought 
by the fide of their relations, of their friends, 
their neighbours, or their rivals : none dared be 
guilty of cowardice in prefence of fuch wit- 
neftes. 

There, there was eftablifhed a calm and eafy 
tetreat for thofe who had deferved well of their 
country. This it would be eafy for us to imi- 
tate, and even to furpafs by turning into magni- 
ficent military colleges, Verfaiiles, and all the 
palaces of defpots, for thofe heroes of liberty, 
who fhall have vanquifhed them. 

There, was to be feen the mold affecting infti- 
tution, which was ever praddifed by any people, 
the laft day of the feaft of Bacchus, at the 
conclufion of the laft tragedy, in prefence of the 
fenate, of the army, and of a crowd of citi- 
zens, a herald prefented to the people a number 
of young orphans, the adopted children of the 
nation, in thefe terms : “ Behold the fons of

country. The people who have adopted them, 
have brought them up till they have attamed 
the age of twenty, and this day, in which they ar- 
rive at that period, the people gives them a com- 
plete fuit of armour, fends them back to their 
friends, and afligns to them the moft honour- 
able feats in all places of public entertainment. 

I acknowledge, we have not yet engrafted a- 
mongft us all thefe noble inftitutions ; I acknow- 
ledge, that the date is not in this moment en- 
tirely exempt from diforders, anarchy, and pil- 
lage ; but was it poflible to fweep out fo great an 
empire, without occafioning a little dull and 
dirt. The nation has luffered, but was it pof- 
fible to cure it, without making it thinner ? 
She has paid an excehive price for every thing, 
but it is her ranfom that die pays, and (he will 
not always be betrayed. We have already ac- 
complilhed the oath the neared the heart of a 
citizen; that oath which every young man of 
Athens made on becoming 18 years of age, 
“ To leave his country more rich and flouridling 
than he found it.” — We found France a mo- 
narchy, and we fhall leave it a republic. 

Let fools and coxcombs then daily repeat that 
old adage of oi}r grandmothers, that a repub- 
lican 


( «4 ) 

ilcan government is not fuited to France, — Red 
heels and fcarlet robes, the courtiers of the anti- 
chambers, and the court i^ans of the Palais 
Royal, chicanery and Pharoah, pimping and 
proftitution ; frock-jobbers, and financeers ; fpies 
and fharpers, rogues and infamous men of all 
defcriptions ; and lafily, priefls, who abfolved you 
from every crime on condition of tythes : thefe 
are the profeffors, thefe are the men to whom a 
monarchy is neceffary ; but although it Ihould be 
true, that formerly republicanifm and democracy 
could never take root in a country of fo large 
extent as France ; yet the knowledge and lights 
of the 18th century, makes abfurd all compa- 
nion between this and ancient times. Plato faid, 
if a painter fhewed you a woman whofe charms 
furpaffed even imaginary ideas of perfect beauty, 
would you find fault with her, becaufe there 
never yet exifled one fo handfome ; for my part, 
I maintain that plain common fenfe will fee 
evidently that a Republic alone can keep the 
promife to France, vainly made by monarchsfor 
200 years— -a fowl on every man’s table. * 

* Henry the Fourth ufed to fay, that if he lived, he 
hoped to make France fo flourifliing, that the poorelt man 
in his kingdom Ihould have his fowl and pot, i. e. it is then 
in the pot.

POSTSCRIPT. 

THIS Fragment does not contain the tenth 
part of the hiftory of the Briftbtins ; the greateft 
number of thefe fadts having been wrapped up 
in darknefs,or elfe having taken place at a diftance 
fo great, as to be out of the reach of my telefcope. 
It mud therefore be left to time and chance to 
reveal to us certain anecdotes ; fucli as, for in- 
fiance, that of the death of Favras *, which I 
related in the fourth number of “ La 'Tribune des 
Patriots Time will alfo inform us how the 
Prince de Poix efcaped from the Mayor’s houfe 
on the nth of Augufi, and what Angel en- 
tranced his guards, and led him forth from the 
mayor Pethion’s houfe, in a manner as miracu- 
lous as St. Peter from his chains.— Hiftory will 
learn from his fervant whether this prodigy was 
owing to the hundred thoufand crowns given to 
his municipal keepers, as was then faid, or 

* Camille Defmoulin pretends, that Favras was faved 
from death by braces, which pafTed from under his arms to 
the gibbet, and prevented his hanging, and that he has 
fince been l’een at Bruflels. The improbability of fuch a 
faft, is a fufficrent proof again!! it, befides which, when in 
a foreign country, there could be no reafon for Mr. d'"' 
Favras to conceal his exigence.

furreAion. I have it from very good authority, 
that it was to this order figned Pethion, that 
■rhiJhpe Noailies owes his fafety. — Whether it 
was given them by Mandat, or by what Other 
means they obtained this precious writing, is of 
httle confequence, but fome perfons nearly con. 
nected with the Prince dePoix, held that order 
m their hands, when they came to folicit his re- 
leafe from Pethion, and when he made fome dif- 
ficulties on taking upon himfelf fo dangerous 
a tep as that of liberating the Captain of 
tfi e Royal Guards, they determined him by the 
.ear of a greater danger, and ihewing him the 
paper, threatened, unlefs he fayed his prifoner 
, /he guillotine, to place him, himfelf, under 
the iatal razor.-It is faid, that there was no 
need of repeating this twice to Pethion, for 
e ound out a back door, which he Opened for 
the captain of the guards. 

I have even omitted feveral fads of public no- 
nety ; fuch for mfiance, as that which Meaulle 

TTV n f. he r Tribune > as being himfelf affured 
of the truth of it, that the leaders of the right 

fide wilhed to maffacre the Mountain, and that 
ar aroux, one of their chiefs, had dared to 
g-ve orders to the ad battalion of Marfeilles 
and command them to furround the Convention 
the evening before fentence was patfed on the 

King,

King. — But what I have already related, is fuffi- 
cient to prove the guilt of the Balloting, and that 
their trial may be looked on as completely finilhed, 
and it is clear, for inftance, that from the authentic 
papers I have quoted, that Roland ought to have 
been delivered overto the Revolutionary Tribunal 
the inflant that, in the fearch of his papers thofe 
pieces had been found, which would have put 
his- condemnation beyond all doubt ?— Is it not 
fui&ient to raife ones indignation, that Ciavieie 
and Le Bran his accomplices in counter-revolu- 
tion, and like him, refponfible for all the blood- 
shed in La Vendee, fhould Bill retain their places

of negligence, am I wrong in merely accufing of 
weaknefs the Committee or Public Safety ?
