Tranflator’s Preface. 

t / 


The French Revolution has been the fubjeCl of 
various fpeculations, and various hiftories. As 
might be expected, the Royalifts and the Repub- 
licans have differed a good deal in their accounts of 
the principles of that revolution, of the fprings 
which have fet it in motion, and of the true cha- 
racter of thofe who have been, or ftill are the 
principal aCtors on that aftonifhing fcene. 

They who are inclined to think favourably of 
that event, will undoubtedly objeCt to every Rate 
of faCts which comes only from the authority of 
a Royalift. Thus much mud be allowed by thofe 
who are the mod firmly attached to the caufe of 

religion, law, and order (for of fuch, and not of 

• 

friends to defpotifm, the royal party is compofed) 
that their very affedlion to this generous and manly 

a a caufe. 


( iv ) 

caufe, and their abhorrence of a revolution, not 
lefs fatal to liberty than to government, may pof- 
fibly lead them in fome particulars to a more harfh 
reprefentation of the proceedings of their adverfa- 
ries, than would be allowed by the cold neutrality 
of an impartial judge. This fort of error arifes 
from a fource highly laudable ; but the exadtnefs 
of truth may fuffer even from the feelings of vir- 
tue. Hiftory will dojuftice to the intentions of 
worthy men ; but it will be on its guard againft 
their infirmities ; t it will examine with great ftridt- 
ncfs of fcrutiny, whatever appears from a writer 
in favour of his own caufe. Oil the other hand, 
whatever efcapes him, and makes againft that 
caufe, comes with the greateft weight. 

In this important controverfy, the tranflator of 
the following work brings forward to the Englifli 
tribunal of opinion, the teftimony of a witnefs be- 
yondall exception. His competence is undoubted. 
He knows every thing which concerns this revolu- 
tion to. the bottom. He is a chief aftor in all the 
fcenes which he prefents. No man can objeft to 
him as a royalift : the royal party, and the Chriftian 
religion, never had a more determined enemy. In 

a word 


a word, it is BRISSOT. — It is Briffot the Repub- 
lican, the Jacobin, and the Philofopher, who is 
brought to give an account of Jacobinifm, and of 
Republicanifm, and of Philofophy. 

It is worthy of obfervation, that this his account 
of the genius of Jacobinifm, and its effects, is not 
confined to the period in which that faction came 
to be divided within itfelf. In feveral, and 
thofe very important particulars, Briffot’ s obferva- 
tion s apply to the whole of the preceding period, 
before the great fchifm, and whilft the Jacobins 
^a£led as one body: infomuch, that the far 

greater part of the proceedings of the ruling 
powers, fince the commencement of the revolu- 
tion in France, fo ftrikingly painted, fo ftronglv 
and fo juftly reprobated by Briffot, were the a-ftsof 
Briffot himfelf and his affociates. All the mem- 
bers of the Girondin fubdivifion were as deeplv 
concerned as any of the Mountain could poffibly 
be, and fome of them much more deeply, in thofe 
horrid tranfaflions which have filled all the think- 
ing part of Europe with the greateft deteftarion, 
and with the moft ferious apprehenfions for the 
common liberty and fafety.

A quef-

C Vi ) 

A queftion will very naturally be afked, what 
could induce Briffot to draw fuch a pidure ? He 
muft have been fenlible it was his own. The 
anfwer is — the inducement was the fame with 
that which led him to partake in the perpetration 
of all the crimes, the calamitous effects of which 
he delcribes with the pen of a matter, — Ambition. 
His fadion having obtained their ftupendous and 
unnatural power, by rooting out of the minds of 
his unhappy countrymen every principle of reli- 
gion, morality, loyalty, fidelity, and honour, 
difcovered, that when authority came into their 
hands, it would be a matter of no fmall difficulty 
for them to carry on government on the principles 
by which they had deft roved it. 

The rights of men, and the new principles of 
liberty and equality, were very unhandy inftru- 
ments for thofe who wifhed to eftablifh a fyftem of 
tranquillity and order. They who were taught to 
find nothing tc refped in the title and in the vir- 
tues of Louis the Sixteenth, a prince fucceedingto 
the throne by the fundamental laws, in the line of 
a lucceffion of monarchs continued for fourteen 
, hundred years, found nothing which could bind

them to an implicit fidelity, and dutiful allegiance 
to MeflT. Briffot, Vergniaux, Condorcet, Ana- 
charfis Cloots, and Thomas Paine. 

In this difficulty, they did as well as they 
could. To govern the 1 people, they muft incline 
the people to obey. The work was difficult, 
but it was neceffary. They were to accomplifh 
it by fuch materials and by fuch inftruments as 
they had in their hands. They were to accomplifh 
the purpofes of order, morality, and fubmiflion to 
the laws, from the principles of atheifm, profligacy, 
and fedition. Ill as the difguife became them, they 
began toaflume themafk of an auftereand rigid vir- 
tue ; they exhaufted all the (lores of their eloquence 
(which in fome of them were not inconfiderable) 
in declamations, againfl tumult and confufion ; 
they made daily harangues on the bleffings of or- 
der, difcipline, quiet, and obedience to authority; 
they even fhewed fome fort of difpofition to pro- 
tect fuch property as had not been confifcated. 
They, who on every occafion had difcovered a fort 
of furious thirfl of blood, and a greedy appetite for 
(laughter, who avowed and gloried in the murders 
and maffacres of the 14th of July, of the 5th and 

6 th 


( viu ) 

6 th of October, and of the ioth of Auguft, now 
began to be fqueamifh and faftidious with regard 
to thofe of the 2d of September. 

In their pretended fcruples on the fequel of the 
{laughter of the 10th of Auguft, they impofed 
upon no living creature, and they obtained not 
the fmalleft credit for humanity. They endea- 
voured to eftablifh a difiityclion, by the belief of 
which they hoped to keep the fpirit of murder 
iafely bottled up, and lealed for their own pur- 
poies, without endangering themfelves by the 
fumes of the potion which they prepared for their 
enemies. 

Roland was the chief and the mod accredited 
of the faSion : — His morals had furnifhed little 
matter of exception againfl him ; — old, domeftic, 
and uxorious, he led a private life fufficiently 
blamelefs. He was therefore fet up as the Cato 
of the republican party, which did not abound in 
fuch charafters. 

This man, like moft of the chiefs, was the 
manager of a newfpaper, in which he promoted 
the intereft of his party. He was a fatal prefent 
piade by the revolutionifts to the unhappy king,

as one of his minifters under the new conftitu- 
tion. Amongft his colleagues were Claviere and 
Servan. All the three have fince that time, either 
loft their heads by the axe of their aftbciates in 
rebellion, or to evade their own revolutionary 
juftice, have fallen by their own hands. 

Thefe minifters were regarded by the king as 
in a confpiracy to dethrone him. Nobody who 
confiders the circumftances which preceded the 
depofition of Louis the fixteenth ; nobody who 
attends to the fubfequent conduit of thofe minis- 
ters, can hefitate about the reality of fuch a con- 
fpiracy. The king certainly had no doubt of it : 
he found himfelf obliged to remove them ; and 
the neceflity which firft obliged him to choofe 
fuch regicide minifters, conftrained him to 
replace them by Dumourier the Jacobin, and fome 
others of little efficiency, though of a better dif- 
cription. 

A little before this removal, and evidently as 
a part of the confpiracy, Roland put into the 
king’s hands as a memorial, the moft infolent, fedi- 
tious, and atrocious libel, that has probably ever 
been penned. This paper Roland a few dqys

after delivered to the National Affembly,* who in- 
ftantly publifhed and difperfed it over all France ; 
and in order to give it the itronger operation, 
they declared, that he and his brother minifters 
had carried with them the regret of the nation. 
None of the writings which have inflamed the 
Jacobin fpirit to a favage fury, ever worked up a 
fiercer ferment through the whole mafs of the 
republicans in every part of France. 

Under the thin veil of prediction, he ftrongly 
recommends all the abominable praftices which 
afterwards followed. In oarticular he inflamed 
the minds of the populace againft: the refpe£table 
dnd confcientious clergy, who became the chief 
objedb of the maflacre, and who were to him the 
chief objefts of a malignity and rancour that one 
could hardly think to exifl: in an human heart. 

We have the reLques of his fanatical perfec- 
tion here. We are in a condition to judge of the 
merits of the perfecutors and of the perfecuted —

fuffered in their mafTacre, or by their decree of 
exile. 

The king had declared that he would fooner 
perifli under their axe, (he too well faw what 
was preparing for him) than give his fanftion to 
the iniquitous adt of profeription, under which 
thofe innocent people were to be tranfported. 

On this profeription of the clergy, a principal 
part of the oftenfible quarrel between the king 
and thofe miniflers, had turned. From the time of 
the authorifed publication of this libel, fome 
of the manoeuvres long and uniformly purfued for 
the king’s depofition, became more and more M 

evident and declared. 

The tenth of Auguft came on, and in the 
manner in which Roland had predicted i it was 
followed by the fame confequences — The king 
was depofed, after cruel maffacres, in the courts 
and the apartments of his palace, and in almoft 
all parts of the city. In reward of his treafbn to 
his old matter, Roland was by his new matters 
named rninifter of the home department,

The maflacres of the fecond of September were 
begotten by the maflacres of the tenth of Auguft. 
They were univerfally forefeen and hourly ex- 
pected. During the fliort interval between the 
two murderous fcenes, the furies, male and 
female, cried out havock as loudly and as fiercely 
as ever. The ordinary jails were all filled with 
prepared victims ; and when they overflowed. 
Churches were turned into jails. At this time the 
relentlefs Roland had the care of the °*eneral 
police; he had for his colleague the bloody 

Dantonj who wasminifterofjuftice:— -Theinlidious 

Petion was mayor of Paris — The treacherous 

Manuel was procurator of the Common-hall. 

The magiftrates (fome or all of them) were evi- 
dently the authors of this maflacre. Left the 
national guards fhould, by their very name, be 
reminded of their duty in prelerving the lives of 
their fellow citizens, the common council of 
Paris, pretending that it was in vain to think of 
refilling the murderers, (although in truth neither 
fheir numbers nor their arms were at all formi- 
dable) obliged . thofe guards to draw the charges 
from theirmulqucts, and took away their bayonets. 

One

One of their journalifts, and according to their 
fafhion, one of their leading ftatefmen, Gorfas, 
mentions, this fa£t in his newfpaper, which he 
formerly called the Galley Journal. The title 
was well fuited to the paper and its author. 
For fome • felonies he had been fentenced to 
the gallies ; but by the benignity of the late 
king, this felon (to be one day advanced to 
the rank of a regicide) had been pardoned and 
releafed, at the interceffion of the ambaffadors of 
Tippoo Sultan. His gratitude was fuch as might 
naturally have been expected; and it has lately 
been rewarded as it delerved. This liberated 
Galley-flave was raifed, in mockery of all criminal 
law, to be minifter of juftice : he became from his 
elevation a more confpicuous objed of accufation; 
and he has fince received the punishment of his 
former. crimes in profcription and death. 

It will be afked, how the minifter of the home 
department was employed at this crifis ? The 
day after the maflacre had commenced Roland 
appeared, but not with the powerful apparatus of 
a protefting magiftrate, to refcue thofe who had 
furvived the {laughter of the firft day Nothing

( xiv ) 

of this. On the third of September, (that is the 
day after the commencement of the maffacre)* 
he writes a long, elaborate, verbofe epiftle to the 
A f!embly . in which, after magnifying, according 
to the bon ton of the revolution, his own integrity, 
humanity, courage, and patriotifm, he firft di- 
re£Hy justifies all the bloody proceedings of the 
tenth of Auguft. He confiders the flaughter of 
that day as a necefiary meafure for defeating a 
confpiracy, which (with a full knowledge of the 
falfehood of his affertion) he afferts to have been 
formed for a maffacre of the people of Paris, and 
which he more than infinuates, was the work of 
his late unhappy matter, who was univerfally 
known to carry his dread of fhedding the blood 
of his moft guilty fubjects to an excefs. 

“ Without the day of the tenth,” fays he, “ it 
“ is evident that we fliould have been loft. The 
“ court » prepared for a long time, waited for the 
“ h° ur which was to accumulate all treafons, 
“ to difplay over Paris the ftandard of death, and

“ t0 rei g n there by terror. The fenfe of the 
“ people, (le fentiment) always jujl and ready 
when their opinion is not corrupted, forefaw 
the epoch marked for their deftrudlion, and 
“ rendered it fatal to the confpirators.” He then 
proceeds, in the cant which has been applied to 
palliate all their atrocities from the fourteenth of 
July, 1789, to the prefent time ; — “ It is in the 
“ nature of things,” continues he, “ and in that 
“ of £ he human heart, that victory ftould bring 
“ with it fome excefs. The fea, agitated by % 
“ violent ftorm, roars long after the tempeft ; but 
“ ever y thin S has bounds, which ought at length 
“ to be oblerved.” 

In this memorable epiftle, he confiders 
fuch excejjes as fatalities a riling from the 

very nature of things, and confequently not to be 
punilhed. He allows a {pace of time for the 
duration of thefe agitations ; and left he ftiould be 
thought rigid and too fcanty in his meafure, he 
thinks it may be long. But he would have things 

to ceale at length. But when, and where ? 

When they may approach his own perfon.

with that warmth and force of affertion, which 
“ ftrike the imagination and feduce it for a 
moment, and which miflead and deftroy con-

f ‘ in place in a free government. Yejlerday, 
“ again, in an affembly of the prefidents of all 
‘‘ the fe&ions, convoked by the minifters, with 
“ the view of conciliating all minds, and of 
mutual explanation, I perceived that dijlrujl 
“ which fu/pecis. Interrogates , and fetters opera- 
4i tions” 

In this manner, (that is, in mutual fufpicions 
and interrogatories) this virtuous minifter of the 
borne department, and all the magiftracy of Paris, 
fpent the firft day of the maffacre, the atrocity pf 
which has fpread horror and alarm throughout Eu- 
rope. It does not appear that the putting a flop to 
the maffacre, had any part in the objeft of their 
meeting, or in their conlultations when they were 
met. Here was a minifter tremblingly alive to 
his own fafety, dead to that of his fellow citizens, 
eager to prelerve his place, and worfe than indif- 
ferent about its moft important duties. Speaking 
of the people, he fays, “ that their hidden 

“ enemies

“ enemies may make ufe of this agitation ,” (the 
tender appellation which he' gives to horrid 
mafTacre) “ to hurt their bejl friends, and their 
“ mof able defenders. Already the example be-

dignation carried to its height commences 
“ profcriptions which fall only on the guilty , 
but in which error and particular paflions may 
“ Ihortly involve the honef man." 

He faw that the able artificers in the trade and 
myftery of murder, did not chufe that their fkill 
fhottld be unemployed after their firft work ; and 
that they were full as ready to cut off their rivals 
as their enemies. This gave him one alarm, that 
was leiious. This letter of Roland in every part 
of it lets out the fecret of all the parties in this 
revolution. Plena rimarum ef ; hac, atque iliac 
perfluit. We fee that none of them condemn the 
occafional practice of murder; provided it is pro- 
perly applied ; provided it is kept within the 
bounds, which each of thole parties think 
proper to prefcribe. In this cafe Roland fear- 
ed, that if what was occafionally ufeful, fhould 
become habitual, the practice might go further 
than was convenient. It might involve the bell

( xviii ) 

friends of the laft revolution, as it had done the 

heroes cf the firft revolution : he feared that it 

would not be confined to the La Fayettes and 

Clemerit-Tonnerres, the Duponts, and Barnaves, 

but that it might extend to the Briflots and Ver- 

ginaux’s, to the Condorcets, the Petions, and to 

himfelf. Under this apprehenfion there is no 

doubt that his humane feelings were altogether 

o o 

unaffedted. 

His obfervations on the maffacre of the pre- 
ceding day are fuch as cannot be paffed over : — 

i 

44 Yefterday,” faid he, 44 was a day upon the 
44 events of which it is perhaps neceflfary to leave 
“ a veil ; — I know that the people with their 
44 vengeance mingled a fort of juflice ; they did 
4< not take for vidtims all who prefented them- 
44 felves to their fury; they diredled it to them 
4 4 who had for a long time been fpared by the 
44 fword of the law , and who they believed, , from 
44 the peril of circumftances, fhould be facrificed 
44 without delay. But I know that it is eafy to 
44 villains and traitors to mifreprefent this effer - 
44 vefcence , and that it muft be checked ; I know 
44 that we owe to all France the declaration, that 
44 the executive power could not forefee or pre-

u this excefs. I know, that it is due to the 
“ constituted authorities to place a limit to it, or 
“ confider themfelves as abolished ” 

In the midSt of this carnage he thinks of 
nothing but throwing a veil over it ; which was 
at once to cover the guilty from punishment, 
and to extinguish all compaflion for the fufferers. 
He apologifes for it; in fail, he justifies it. He 
who (as the reader has juft feen in what is quoted 
from this letter) feels fo much indignation at 
vague denunciations” when made againfl him- 
f cl L and from which he then feared nothing more 
than the fubverfion of his power, is not afhamed 
to confider the charge of a confpiracy to maffacre 

againft his mailer upon de- 
nunciations as vague as poftible, or rather upon 
no denunciations, as a perfect juftification of the 
monftrous proceedings again ft him. He is not 
alhamed to call the murder of the unhappy priefts 
in the Cannes, who were under no criminal de- 
nunciation whatfoever, “a. vengeance mingled with 
a fort of jufice he obferves that “ they had 
been a Jong time 1 pa red by the.fword of the law,” 
and calls by anticipation all thofe who fhould re- 
prefent this “ effervefcence" in other colours, vil-

Jains and traitors : he did not then forefee, how 
foon himfelf and his accomplices would be under 
the neceffity of affuming the pretended charac- 
ter of .this new fort of 64 % nllany and tfeafonf 
in the hope of obliterating the memory of their 
former real villanies and treafons : — he did not 
forefee, that in the courfe of fix months a formal 
manifefto on the part of himfelf and his faftion, 
written by his confederate Briffot, was to reprefent 
this 44 efervefcence ” as another 64 St. Bartholo- 
mew.” and fpeak of it as <4 having made humanity 
f judder, and.fuJlied the Revolution for ever”* 

It is very remarkable that he takes upon him- 
felf to know the motives of the aflaflins, their 
policy, and even what they 44 believed.” How 
could this be if he had no connexion with 
them ? He pvaifes the murderers for not 
having taken as yet all the lives of thofe 
who had, as he calls it, 44 prefented themfclves as 
vi&ims to their fury.” He paints the miferable 
prifoners who had been forcibly piled upon one 
another in the church of the Carmelites, by his 
faftion, prefen ting thenifelves as victims to their

fury ; 


( xxi ) 

fury; as if death was their choice;- or, (allowing 
the idiom of his language to make this equivocal) 
as if they were by fome accident prefented to the 
fury of their aflaffins : whereas he knew, that the? 
leaders of the murderers fought thefe pure and 
innocent vi£tims in the places where they had de- 
pofited them, and were fure to find them. The 
very feleition, which he praifes as a fort ofjufice 
tempering their fury, proves beyond a doubt, the 
forefight, deliberation, and method with which 
this maflacre was made. He knew that circum- 
ftance on the very day of the commencement 
of the mafiacres, when, in all probability, he had 
begun this letter, for he prefented it to the Aflem- 
bly on the very next. 

Whilft, however, he defends thefe a£ts, he is 
confcious that they will appear in another light 

to the world. He therefore acquits the executive 

* 

power, that is, he acquits himfelf (but only by 
his own alfertion) of thofe acts “ of vengeance 
mixed with a fort of juflicef as “ an excefs which 
he could neither forefee nor prevent.’’ He could 

not, he fays, forefee thefe acts ; when he tells us, 

• ' \ * 

the people of Paris had fagacity fo well to forefee 
the defigns of the court on the ioth of Auguft ; to 

forefee 


C xxii ) 

forefee them fo well, as to mark the precife epoch, 
on which they were to be executed, and to con- 
trive to anticipate them on the very day : he 
could not forefee thefe events, though he declares 
in this very letter that victory muji bring with it 
fome excejs “ that the fea roars long r the 
tempeft.” So far as to his forelight. As to his 
difpofition to prevent, if he had forefeet! the maf- 
facres of that day; this will be judged by his care 
w putting a flop to the maffacre then going on. 
This was no matter of forefight. He was in the 
very midft of it. He does not fo much as pre- 
tend, that he had ufed any force to put a flop to 
it. But if he had ufed any, the fainftion given 
under his hand, to a fort of jufHce in the mur- 
derers, was enough to difarm the proteaing force. 

That approbation of what they had already 
done, had its natural effeaon the executive affaflins, 
then in the paroxifm of their fury, as well as on 
their employers, then in the midft of the execu- 
tion of their deliberate cold-blooded fyftem of 
murder. He did not at all differ from either of 
them in the principle of thofe executions, but only 
m the time of their duration; and that only as it 
affected hirnfelf. This, though to him a great 

confideration, 



( xxiii ) 

ccnfideration, was none to his confederates, who 
were at the fame time his rivals* They were 
encouraged to accomplifh the work they had in 
hand. They did accomplish it ; and whilft this 
grave moral epiftle from a grave minifter, recom- 
mending a ceflation of their work of vengeance

aftembly, the authors of the maffacres proceeded 
without interruption in their bufinefs for four 
days together; that is, until the ;th of that 
month, and until all the vidlims of the firft pro- 
fcription in Paris and at Verfailles, and feveral 
other places, were immolated at the fhrine of the 
grim Moloch of liberty and equality. — All the 
priefts, all the reyalifts, all the firft efTayifls and 
novices of revolution in 1789, that could be found, 
were promifcuoufly put to death. 

Through the whole of this long letter of Ro- 
land, it is curious to remark how the nerve and 
vigour of his ftyle, which had fpoken fo potently 
to his Sovereign, is relaxed, when he addrefles 
himfelf to the fans-culott es ; how that ftrength 
and dexterity of arm, with which he parries and 
beats down the fcepter, is enfeebled and loft, when 
he comes to fence with the poignard ! When he

Ho\vc\ er, after what had pafled had been 
praiied, or excufed, or pardoned, he declares 
loudly again ft fuch proceedings in future . Crimes 
had pioneered and made fmooth the way for the 
march of the virtues ; and from that- time, order 
and juftice, and a facred regard for perfonal pro- 
perty, were to become the rules for the new de- 
mocracy. Here Roland and the BrifTotins leagued 
foi their own prefervation, by endeavouring to

of the parts of Brifl'ot’s pamphlet, in which 
Roland’s views and intentions are fo often alluded 
to, the more intelligible in themfelves, and the more 
ufeful in then application by the Englifh reader. 

Under the cover of thefe artifices, Roland, 
Bnflot, and theia. party hoped to gain the bankers,

fignats, and purchafers of the eonfifcated lands of 
the clergy and gentry, to join with their party, as 
holding out fome fort of fecurity to the effefts 
which they poffefled, whether thefe effefts were 
the acquifitions of fair commerce, or the gairte of 
jobbing in the misfortunes of their country, and 
the plunder of their fellow citizens. In this de- 
fign the party of Roland and Briffot fucceeded in 
a great degree. They obtained a majority in the 
National Convention. Compofed however as that 
Afiembly is, their majority was far from Ready ; 
but, whilft they appeared to gain the Convention, 
and many of the outlying departments, they loft 
the city of Paris entirely and irrecoverably ; it was 
fallen into the hands of Marat, Roberfpierre, and 
Danton. Their inftruments were the Sans cu- 
lottes, or rabble, who domineered in that capital, 
and were wholly at the devotion of thofe in- 
cendiaries, and received their daily pay. The 
people of property were of no confequence, and 
trembled before Marat and his janiffaries. As that 
great man had not obtained the helm of the ftate, 
it was not yet come to his turn to aft the part of 
Briffot and his friends, in the affection of fubordi- 
nation and regular government. But Roberfpierre 

d has 


( xxvi ) 

has fur'vived both thefe rival chiefs, ~and is now 
the great patron of Jacobin order. 

To balance the exorbitant power of Paris 
(which threatened to leave nothing to the Na- 
tional Convention, but a character as infigni- 
ficant as that which the ’firft aflembly had 
affigned to the unhappy Louis the Sixteenth)' 
the fadtion of Briflot, whofe leaders were Ro- 
land, Petion, Vergniaux, Ifnard, Condorcet* 
Sec. Sec. &c. applied themfelves to gain the 
great commercial towns, Lyons, Marfeilles, 
Rouen, Nantz, and Bourdeaux. The republi- 
cans of the Briffotin defcnption, to whom the con- 
cealed royalifts, ftill very numerous, joined them- 
felves, obtained a temporary fuperiority, in all 
thefe places. In Bourdeaux on account of the 
activity and eloquence of fome of its repre-- 
fentatives, this fuperiority was the moft dif- 
tinguiflied. This lafi city is feated on the 
Garonne or Gironde ; and being the center of a 
department named from that river, the appel- 
lation of Girondiits was given to the whole 
party. Thefe and fome other towns declared 
ftrongly againft the principles of anarchy; and 
againft the delpotifm of Paris. Numerous ad-*

dreffes were feat, to the Convention, promifmg to 
maintain its authority, which the addrelTers were 
pleafed to conlider as legal and coudituuonal, 
though chofeu, not to compofe an executive go- 
vernment, but to form a pi an for a couflitution. 
In the Convention meafures were, taken to obtain 
an armed force from the feveral departments to 
maintain the freedom of that body, and to pro- 
vide for the pejrfcnal fafety of , the members ; nei- 
ther of which, from the.* 4 th °f J uly I 7 2 9 -to; this

hlies feting 1 under any denomination. 

. This- fchetnej which wasewell conceived, had 
ys-rit thedefired fuccefs. Pan's, from which the 
-Convention : did not dare to move, though feme 
threats, of fuch a departure were from time to time 
thrown out, was too powerful for the party of 

Gironde. Some of the rpropofed guards, but nei-

ther with regularity nor in force, did indeed ar- 
rive ; they vvere debauched as fall as they came ; 
or were lent to the frontiers. The game played 
by the Revolution ills in 1789 with refpedl tQ the 
French guards of the unhappy King, was now 
played againft the departmental guards,, called 
together for the protection of the Revolution ills.

Every part of their own policy eomes round, and 
ftrikes at their own power and their own lives. 

The Parilians, on their part, were not flow iti 
taking the alarm. They had' juft reafon to ap- 
prehend, that if they permitted the fmalleft delay, 
they ftiould lee themfelves befieged by an army 
colle&ed from all parts of France. Violent threats I 
were thrown out againft that city in the Aflembly. 

Its total deftru&ion was menaced. A very re- 
markable exprefhon was uled in thele debates, 

“ that in future times it might be inquired oh 
“ what part of the Seine Paris had flood.” The 
fa&ion which ruled in Paris, too bold to be 
intimidated, and too vigilant to be furprifed, 
in ftantly armed themfelves. In their turn they 
accufed the Girondifts of a trealonable defign to 
break the republic one and indivijible, (whole 
unity as they contended could only be preferved 
by the fupremacy of Paris) into a number of con- 
■federate commonwealths. The Girondin faction 
on this account received alfo the name of federa*

hative, — either that city muft be reduced to a 
mere member of the Federative Republic, or, the 
Convention, chofen, as they Taid, by all France, 
was to be brought regularly and fyftematically 
under the dominion of the Common-hall, and 
even of any one of the feftions of Paris. 

In thiV awful cor. ted, thus brought to nTue, the 
^reat mother club of the Jacobins was entirely in 
The Parifian intereft. The Girondins no longer 
dared to (hew their faces in that affembiy. Nine 
tenths at leaft of the Jacobin Clubs throughout 
France, adhered to the great patriarchal Jacobi- 
niere of Paris, to which they were (to ufe their 
own term) affiliated. No authority of magiftracy, 
judicial or executive, had the leaft weight, when- 
ever thefe clubs chofe to interfere; and they chofe 
to interfere in every thing, and on every occafion. 
AH hope of gaining them to the fupport of 
property, or to the acknowledgement o£ any law 
but their own will, was evidently vain, and hope- 
lefs. Nothing but an armed mfurreftion againft 
their anarchical authority, could anfwer the pur- 
pofe of the Girondins.— Anarchy was to be cured 
by rebellion, as it had been caufed by it.

As a prcWy. to this attempt on the Jaco- 
bms and the commons of Paris, which it was 
hoped would be fupported by all the remaining 
property of France, it became abfolutely necefTat

the whole policy, genius, charader, and conduit 
of the partifans of club government, To make 
lt “ “P 01 "' 0 " as Wly and dearly as it ought' ro 
be made, it was of the fame unavoidable neceffity 
t° go through a feries of tranfadions, in which dl 
thofe concerned in this revolution, were at the f e - 
veral periods, of their adivity, deeply involved. 
In confequence of this de%,, a „d under thefe 
difficulties, BrilTot prepared the following deck- 
rauon of -his party, which he executed with no 
imall ability.; ail d in this manner, the whole 

myftery of -the French, Revolution yvas laid opeu 
in all its pa Pts.

It is almoffi noedlels to mention ' to, the reader 
the fate of the delign to which this pamphlet was 
to be fubfbrvient. The Jacobins of Paris were 

more prompt -than their adverfaries. They were 

the readied: to refort to what La Fayette calls the 
vwftjacred of all duties., that of infur reSlion. 
Another tera of holy infurredion, commenced 

the 


( xxxi ) 

the 31ft of lafi: May. As the firft fruits of that 
infurre&iori grafted on infurreftion, and of that 
rebellion improving upon rebellion, the facred 
irrefponfible chara&er of the members of the 
Convention was laughed to fcorn. They had 
themfelves (hewn in their proceedings againft 
the latte King, how little the moft fixed principles 
are to be relied upon, in their revolutionary con- 
ftitution. The members of the Girondin party 
in the Convention, were lei zed upon or obliged to 
five themfelves by flight. The unhappy author 
of this piece, with twenty of his aflbciates, fuffered 
together on the fcaffold, after a trial, the iniquity 
of which puts all defeription to defiance. 

The Englith reader will draw from this work 
of BriflTot, and from the refukof the laft ftruo-o-les 
of this party, fome ufeful leflons. He will be 
enabled to judge of the information of thofe, 
who have undertaken to guide and enlighten us, 
and who, for reafons beft known to themfelves. 
have chofen to paint the French Revolution and its 
confequences in brilliant and flattering colours. — 
They will know how to appreciate the liberty of 
France, which has been fo much magnified in 
England. — They will do juftice to the wifdom, 

and 


( xxxii ) 

and goodnefs of their Sovereign and his Parlia^ 
mcnt, who have put them into a ftate of de- 
fence, in the war audacioufly made upon us, in 
favour of that kind of liberty. — When we fee (as. 
here we muft fee) in their true colours the cha- 
rafter and policy of our enemies, our gratitude 
will become an a&ive principle. It will produce, 
a ftrong and zealous co-operation with the efforts 
of our government, in favour of a conffitutiou 
under which we enjoy advantages, the full value 
of which, the querulous weaknefsof human nature 
requires fonietimes the opportunity of a cpmparifou a 
to underftand and to relifh. 

Our confidence in thofe who watch for thq 
public will not he lefiened. We fhall be fenlible 
that to alarm us in the late circumftances of our 
affairs, was not for our moleftation, but for our 
Security. We (hall be fenfible that this alarm was. 
not ill timed— and that it ought to have been given, 
as it was given, before the enemy had time fully to, 
mature and accomplifh their plans, for reducing us 
to the condition of France, as that condition is 
faithfully ^nd without exaggeration defcribed in 
the following work. We now have our arms in 
out hands : w ? e have the means of oppofing the

fcnfe, the courage, and the refources of England, 
to the deeped, the mod craftily devifed, the 
bed combined, and the mod extenlivedefign, that 
ever was carried on fince the beginning of the 
world, againd all property, all order, all religion, 
all law, and all real freedom. 

The reader is requeded to attend to the part of 
this pamphlet which relates to the conduit of the 
Jacobins, with regard to the Audrian Netherlands, 
which they call Belgia, or Belgium. It is from 
page 72 to page 84 of this tranflation, Here 
their views and defigns upon all their neighbours 
are fully difplayed. Here the whole mydery of 
their ferocious politics is laid open with the utmod 
clearnefs. Here the manner in which they would 
treat every nation into which they could intro- 
duce their do&rines and influence is didinilly 
marked, We fee that no nation was out of 
danger, and we fee what the danger was with 
which every nation was threatened. The writer 
of this pamphlet throws the blame of feveral of 
the mod violent of the proceedings on the other 
party. He and his friends, at the time alluded to, 
had a majority in the National Adembly. He 
admits that neither he nor they ever publicly 

e oppofed 






( xxxiv ) 

oppofed thefe meafures ; but he attributes their 
filence, to a fear of rendering themfelves fufpeft- 
cd. It is mod certain, that whether from fear, 
or from approbation, they never difcovered any 
diflike of thofe proceedings, till Dumourier was 
driven from the Netherlands. But whatever their 
motive was, it is plain that the moft violent is, 
and fince the revolution has always been, the pre- 
dominant party. 

If Europe could not be laved without our in- 
terpofition, (moft certainly it could not) I am 
fure there is not an Englifhman, who would not 
blulh to be left out of the general effort made in 
favour of the general fafety. But we are not fe- 
condary parties in this war ; *we are principals in 
the danger, and ought to be principals in the exer- 
tion. If any Englifhman alks whether the de- 
figns of the French affaflins are confined to the 
fpot of Europe which they actually defolate, 
the citizen Briffot, the author of this book, and 
the author of the declaration of war againft En°-- 
land, will give him bis anfwer. He will find in 
this book, that the republicans are divided into 
factions, full of the moft furious and deftruftive 
animofity againft each other : but he will find 

alfo 



'/ . * 

( XXXV ) 

# * ✓ ' % 

alfo that there is one point in which they per- 
fectly agree^-that they are all enemies alike, to 
the government of all other nations, and only 
contend with each other about the means of pro- 
pagating their tenets, and extending their empire 
by conqueft. 

It is true, that in this prefent work, which the 
author profeffedly defigned for an appeal to fo- 
reign nations and pofterity, he has drefled up the 
philofophy of his own faction in as decent a garb 
as he could to make her appearance in public : but 
through every difguife her hideous figure may be 
diftinCtly feen. If, however, the reader ftill 
wifhes to fee her in all her naked deformity, I 
would further refer him to a private letter of Briffot 
written towards the end of the laft year, and quoted 
in a late very able pamphlet of Mallet du Pan.

“ the four corners of Europe in that alone is

e 2 thing 


I ( XXXVi ) 

thing is fairly avowed in plain language. The 
triumph of philofophy is- the univerfal conflagra*^ 
tion of Europe ; the only real diflatisfafiion with 
Dumourier is a fufpicion of his moderation ; and 
the fecret motive of that preference, which in this 
very pamphlet the author gives to Miranda, though 
without afligning his reafons, is declared to be the 
fuperior fitnefs of that foreign adventurer for the 
purpofes of fubverfion and deftru&ion. — On the 
other hand, if there can be any man in this country 
fo hardy as to undertake the defence or the apo- 
logy of the prefent monftrous ufurpers of France; 
a nd if it fhould be faid in their favour, that it is 
i*ot juft to credit the charges of their enemy Brif- 
fot againfl them, who have adually tried and con- 
demned him on the very fame charges among 
others ; we are luckily fupplied with the beft'pof- 
fible evidence in fupport of this part of his book 
againfl them : it comes from among themfelves. 
Camille Defmoulins publifhed the 6; Hiftory of 
the Briffotins” in anfwer to this very addrefs of 
Briffot. It was the counter-man ifefto of the laft 
Holy Revolution of the 31ft of May ; and the 
flagitious orthodoxy of his writings at that period 
has been admitted in the late ferutiny of him by 

the 


( xxxvii ) 

the Jacobin Club, when they faved him from that 
guillotine “ which he grazed.” In the begin- 
ning of his work he difplays “ the talk of glory,” 
as he calls it* which prefented itfelf at the open* 
ing of the Convention. All is fummed up in two 
points : “ to create the French republic, and to 
“ diforganize Europe ; perhaps to purge it of its 
6i tyrants by the eruption of the volcanic prin~ 
“ ciples of equality:*'* The coincidence is exa£t $ 
the proof is complete and irrefiftible. 

In a caufe like this, and in a time like the pre* 
fertt, there is no neutrality. They who are not 
a&ively, and with decifion and energy, againft Ja- 
cobinifm, are its partifans. They who do not 
dread it, love it. It cannot be viewed with indif- 
ference. It is a thing, made to produce a powerful 
impreflion on the feelings. Such is the nature of 
Jacobirlifm, fuch is the nature of man, that this 
fyftem muft be regarded either with enthufiaftic 
admiration, or with the higheft degree of detefta- 
tion, -refentment, and horror. 

Another great leflfon may be taught by this book, 
and by the fortune of the author, and his party: 

* See the tranflation of the Hiftory of the Briffotins, by 
Camille Defmoulins, printed for Owen, p. 2. 

I mean 


( xxxviii ) 

I mean a leffon drawn from the confluences 
of engaging in daring innovations, from an hope 
that we may be able to limit their mifchievous 
operation at our plea fu re, and by our policy to fe- 
cure ourfelves again ft the effed of the evil exam- 
ples we hold out to the world. This leffon is 
taught through almoft all the important pages of 
hiftory : but never has it been taught fo clearly 
and fo awfully as at this hour* The revolutionifts 
who have juft fuftered an ignominious death, un- 
der the fentence of the Revolutionary Tribunal 
(a tribunal compofed of thofe with whom 
they had triumphed in the total definition 
of the ancient government) were by no means or- 
dinary men, or without very confiderable talents 
and refources. But with all their talents and re- 
fources, and the apparent momentary extent of 
their power, we fee the fate of their projets, their 
power, and their perfons. We fee before our 
eyes the abfurdity of thinking to eftablifh order 
upon principles of confulion, or with the mate- 
rials and inftruments of rebellion, to build up a 
folid and ftable government. 

Such partifans of a republic amongft us, as may 
not have the worft intentions, will fee, that the 
i principles 


( xxxix ) 

principles, the plans, the manners, the morals, 
and the whole fyftem of France, is altogether as 
adverfe to the formation and duration of any ra- 
tional fcbeme of a republic, as it is to that of a 
monarchy abfolute or limited. It is indeed a 
lyftem which can only anfwer the purpofes of 
* robbers and murderers. 

The tranflator has only to fay for himfelf that 
he has found fome difficulty in this verfion. His 
original author, through hafte, perhaps, or through 
the perturbation of a mind filled with a great and 
arduous enterprize, is often obfcure. There are 
fome paffages too, in which his language re- 
quires to be fil'd tranflated into French, at leaf! 
into fuch French as the academy would in former 
times have tolerated. He writes with great force 
and vivacity; but the language, like everything 
elfe in his country, has undergone a revolution. 
The tranflator thought it bed to be as literal as 
poffible ; conceiving fuch a tranflation would per- 
haps be the mod fit to convey the author’s peculiar 
mode of thinking. In this way the tranflator has 
no credit for dyle ; but he makes it up in fidelity.

THE* 



The Authors Advertifement. 


r HE whole truth has never been told from the 
beginning of the Revolution . Men were afraid 
that in telling it they fhould hurt the caufe of 
liberty \ that they fhould difhonour. it, that they 
fhould difcourage the people, that they fhould 
embarrafs the progrefs of affairs. This circum- 
fpe£lion is proper, and even neceffary, when na- 
tions owe their falvation to particular men, or 
particular bodies of men; but it becomes fatal 
when the nation only can be the means of faving 
itfelf. To conceal from a nation its own fituation 
is to nurfe its lethargy. It cannot be led to make 
great efforts, and to give them their proper direc- 
tion without being fully informed of that fituation. 

Such is our prefent portion, and fuch the mo- 
tive which has engaged me to tear away entirely 
the veil which hides from us the caufe of our 
evils. 

It may, perhaps, be thought that I have been too 
fevere towards many/ndividuals,and to many bodies 
of men. I have told the truth ; it was my duty 
to do fo, and if I have any caufe of regret, it is, 
that the rapidity with which this work has been 
written and printed, has not permitted me to bring 
together all the circumftances which might be 
neceffary to give a juft idea of men and things. 

B There 


I here is, however, one body to whom 1 ou<ft?£ 
here to do juftice ; it is the Revolutionary Tribu- 
nal. I have elfewhere mentioned the mifchief done 
by that body ; I muft here relate the good Chey 
have fiiice done. They condu&ed themfelves in 
Miranda’s trial with the integrity, the firmnefs, 
the impartiality, that was to be expedted from true 
Republicans. May they perfevere in the fame fpi- 
nt, and pofterity will pardon the other judgements 
with which they might juftly be reproached. 

This homage which I pay to this tribunal, I will 
pay to all my enemies, when they (hall do what 
is right ; for my pen is never carried away by 
pa (lion.- I am under the dominion but of onepaf- 
fion when I write, the love of liberty. The defire 
of feeing a Republican Government eftablifhed in 
my country, and philofophy triumphant every 
where , that is the paffion of my life ; the difap- 
pointment of which has fometimes produced that 
violence of expreflion of which I am accufed. 

Oh ! how affii&ing it is for a man who has feen 
the Revolution advanced to a point, to zvhich four 
years ago it would have been folly to imagine it 
could be carried! How affii&ing is it to tee that 
Revolution falling back, while every thin o- was 
co-operating for its eftablifhment ! .After all the 
experience that has been obtained, fhall all be loft 
to liberty , to other nations , to future revolutions ? 
No; if the nation can fucceed in eftablifhincr 
order within her own bofbm— On that word 
depends the liberty of the umverfe, and it is fox 
that alone i write.

TO HIS 


CONSTITUENTS. 


It is time that our fellow citizens, that foreign nations fliould judge 
between us and our adverfaries. It is time that it fliould be feen who 
the men are who with to fave the Republic, and who the men are who 
wifli to deftroy it. The evil is at its height; myftery would be but a 
dangerous palliative.* 


I HAVE announced from the commencement 
of the Convention, that there is in France a party 
of diforganifers, who aimed at the deftruflion of 
the Republic, even in its cradle. 

The exigence of this party has been denied. 
All fincere fceptics ought now to be convinced. 

I now mean to prove, ift. That this party of 
anarch ids has domineered, and does domineer, 
over almoft all the deliberations of the Convention, 
and all the operations of the Executive Council. 

2d. That this party has been, and is ftill, the 
foie caufe of all the evils, as well interior as exte- 
rior, which afflidl France. 

3, That the Republic cannot be faved but 
by taking rigorous meafures to refcue the

B z reprefentatives 


( 4 ) 

reprefentatives of the nation from the defpotifm pf 
this fadion. 

I dread the abufe of words ; it is this abufe that 
gives fo mqch ftrength to political quacks. It 
muft therefore be our firft bufinefs rightly to de- 
fine that anarchy which knaves dexteroufly con- 
found with patriotifm. It muft be defined" before 
I prefent the hideous picture of its crimes, before I 
offer the remedy for our diftempers. 

The laws vyithout execution ; the conftitute^ 
authorities impotent and difgraced ; crimes unpu- 
nifhed ; property of every kind attacked ; perianal 
iafety violated ; the morals of the people corrupted ; 
no conftitution ; no government ; no juftice.— Such 
are the true features of this anarchy ; fpch \s pre- 
cifely the fyftem uniformly followed by the party 
that I have denounced : a fyftem which has ap- 
peared to me fubverfive of all republican govern- 
ment. For that reafon, before I pnter upon my 
fubjed, I muft fet forth the principles which have 
guided me, as well as all the other refpedable de- 
puties to whom I have the honour of calling my- 
felf a friend. 

It was my opinion on coming into the Conven- 
tion, that fince Royalty was annihilated ; fince the 
Republic was eftablifhed ; fince all the powers of 
government were in the hands of the people, or 
their reprefentatives, the patriots ought to change 
the line of their march in confequence of the 
change in their pofition. 

It was my opinion that the infurreffiional move- 
ments ought to ceafe ; becaufe, where there is no 
longer any tyranny to demolifh, there ought no 
longer to exifi any force in a fate of mfurrefflion ; 
becaufe, where to' build is our bufinefs alone, 
there, nothing is wanted but order and reafon. 

I was 


( 5 ^ 

I was aware that at the end of a Revolution, 
of three years {landing, it was difficult enough, 
all at once, tq calm the commotions of *e heop . 
•becaufe their agitation was the natural effeft 
force of events; becaufe tt was the firft * 

the people had ever been in the full exercife of their 
own authority ; hecaufe a people juft emer 0 
from flavery is a child, and that it is quite natural 
that they alfo ihould fometimes break to pieces then 
own work, and rife againft the very authorities 
that they themfelyes had created. . , 

But l" thought at the fame time that if thole po- 
pular impulfes which throw fociety into terrible 
convuliions were continued too long, the people m 
that cafe would tear themfelves to pieces, con- 
ceiving they were only deftroying their tnflru- 

m n 'was my opinion, that they would foon come 
to regret the lethargic tranquillity of their former 
bondage, if care was not taken to procure for 
them a republican tranquillity, becaufe the peop e 
w iftied to be happy ; becauie they more especially 
widi it, when they have made great and long la- 
crifices ; becaufe happinefs does not at all confift 
in the eternal repetition of violent convulfions, 
and if robbers live by fediuons, the people live by 

^ My opinion was, that order alone could procure 
this tranquillity; that order confifted in a religious 
refpect for the laws, the magiftrates, propel ty of 
all kinds, and perfoual fafety ; that this order could 
only relult from the due execution of the lau * ’

inverting all the conftituted authorities with power,

filing, than for the citizen who pofleftes property* 
Becaufe the firft can live only by his conftant labour^ 
and that there can be no conftant work where 
there is not a conftant fafety, both of life and of 
property, to the rich. 

1 thought then, that the trueft enemies of the 
People, and of the Republic, were the anarchifts, 
the preachers up of an Agrarian law, the inftiga- 
tors of fedition. 

I was of opinion, that all infurre&ion could not 
but be fatal to the people, and to liberty, fince it 
could be diredled only againft the reprefentatives 
of the people. 

I conceived that this dottrine of eternal infur - 
region muft draw after it pillage and maflacres, 
which muft weary out and difguft the nation with 
the republican form of government. 

1 thought that the diffolution of this govern- 
ment could only be effected in two ways : 

Either* that the Convention, fubjugated by 
the anarchifts, fhould fall into contempt, and 
fhould iftue decrees that would prove revolting and 
deftrudtive to all the departments, and they all 
fhould demand the renovation of that affembly by 
an inlurredtion againft the fadtious ; or, that our 
external enemies, availing themfelves of thefe 
convulfions, might invade the Republic ; might 
lhare it out among themfelves ; or might fecond 
the attempts of the firft ambitious man who fhould 
endeavour to re-eftablifh the firft Conftitution, or 
the ancient defpotifm. 

I confequently thought that all my efforts ought 
to be direded againft the anarchifts ; fince they 
were the molt formidable enemies to the eftablifh- 
meat of the Republic. 

Such 







C 8 ) 

Such is the fyftem that has uniformly guided 
me in the Convention; I have, therefore, never 
ceafed to mark out the anarchifts of all forts ; both, 
the fools who talk of nothing but tillorganizing,- 
when it is our bufinefs to organize ‘ and the 
knaves, whofe foie view is to acquire riches and 
dominion to themfelves by their revolutionary 
power*, and the ariftocrats and the royalifts in 
difguife, who coalefce with them, in hopes, 
through dilbrder, to reft ore the ancient govern- 
ment. I have never ceafed to unmalk their ma- 
noeuvres, becaule I law in them the certain ruin of 
liberty. 

It is in the lame fpirit that all thofe courageous 
men have joined me in the conflict, who have 
firft been delivered over to ignominy, and then 
to the daggers of alfaflins under the names of 
Rolandines, Girondines, &c. &c. 

And have we not realbn to dread the fatal in- 
fluence of the anarchifts ? Take a view of all that 
has been done by the Convention, by the Executive 
Council, by our Armies ! You will find this fatal 
influence every where alike. 

It is time that truth Ihould be Ihewn ftark naked. 
It is time that our fellow-citizens, that foreign 
nations, Ihould judge between us and our adver- 
faries. It is time that it Ihould be fee n who the 
men are who wilhed to fave the Republic, and 
who the men are who wilhed to deftroy it. The 
evil is at its height. Myftery would be but a 
dangerous palliative ; myftery would expofe the 
Republic to ruin. For now the Republic only 
can work its own falvation ; it muft therefore be 
made acquainted with every thing of which it is 
now ignorant. 

1 Far 


( 9 ) 

Far be from me the idea of wifhhrg todifparage 
the Convention ; I would fhed the iaft drop of 
tny blood to fee the Convention honoured and re- 
vered univerfally. Alas ! what miracles would it 
not have wrought, if it bad been left to its own 
-dire ft ion, ' dive J ted of all external influence ; if rea- 
fon only had prefided in its deliberations. En- 
lightened* wifdom , pamoerfm, ardent love of re- 
.publicanifm, incorruptible probity — all thefe were 
united in this body ! Thefe were the characters 
*of a great majority of its members. Some twenty 
men have pallied and degraded it. Tears of blood 
■ought to flow from the eyes of all Republicans. 
Liberty might Jo eaflly have found no other boun- 
daries than thofe of the world , and now Jhcfltiujl 
Jorrowjully confine herjelf Within the limits of 
France . Can ihe folidly eftablifh herfelf even 

there ? This is {till, and I fpeak it with grief, this 
is {till a problem. And why is it fo r Becaufe a 
J'core of anarchifs have ufurped in the Convention, 
and over the con flit u ted authorities throughout the 
whole empire, an influence whLh reaion alone 
ought to poflefs. 

Citizens of the departments 1 you are con- 
founded, annihilated ! What , twenty men ? Yes! 
Ye, who ftill doubt it, follow me in the enume- 
ration of fa£ts. It is with the documents in my 
hand, that I will convince the credulous. What- 
ever good the Convention has done, the anarchifts 
have found the fee ret of rendering null and 
void. Whatever rmlchief it has done, they have 
diClated. 

Follow the debates, you will there fee on one 
hand, men always occupied with the care of making 
the laws, the conftituted authorities, and private 
property, reipeCted ; and on tt>e other fide, men

( 10 ) 

atwaj 5 employed to keep the people in agitation? 
to dilcredit by calumnies the conftituted authority 5 
to proteft crimes by impunity, and to relax all 
the bonds of fociety. 

In the midlt of this conflict, you will fee the 
majority of the Convention, pure, found, attached 
to principles, inceflantly turning their attention 
towards the law, and inceflantly too, fufferino* 
them (elves to be led by thofe who deftroy it? 
One verfe defcribes them ; but how fhocking is 
this verfe ! a

the principle of a departmental force , propofed by 
-Buzot ; that principle which would have infured 
the independence of their deliberations ; that prin- 
ciple which would have confccrated the unity and 
indivisibility of the Republic; that principle which, 
earned into execution, would have deprived the 
banditu of that force which they abufed, in order 
to hold the national reprefentation in Jlavery : you 
will fee them, then (affrighted by calumnious 
informations, by the words fo often repeated, 
•\T a tori an Guards ; words which infulted the love 
of liberty in Frenchmen,) abandon this propofition. 
t rom that moment the violation of the freedom of 
opinion takes its date. 

You will fee them next applaud the projed of 
a decree, propofed by Buzot, againft the inftigators 
of murder ; feel the neceflity of putting a flop 
to incendiary writings, which every day inflamed 
the banditti, anfl thpn j n foj ence that falutary

project which the anarchifts fo furioufly op- 
poied. 

You will next fee them fan&ion with their una- 
nimous votes, the exclufion of Members of the 
Convention from places during fix years, which 
was propofed by Genfonnc — an exclufion w T hich 
proved the difintereftednefs of the party accufed 
of aiming at the government ; which condemned 
the ambition of the anarch, ifts to filence ; and 
which forced them to give a Con frit ution, pure and 
difengaged from all fecret and particular views — 
you will fee them afterwards commit this wife 
decree, upon the re-iterated inftances of the chiefs 
of the anarchifts themfelves. For the firft objeft 
of their ambition — is Places ; their aim is to 
domineer to-day, and alfo to domineer to- 
morrow. 

You will then fee the Convention moved by the 
charges of triumvirate, and di&atorfhip, preferred 
again it Robefpierre and his accomplices ; convin- 
ced that they had degraded and endeavoured to 
diifolve the legiilative afiembly; and convinced 
that they wi filed to lord it over France, welcome 
in confequence the noble and fpirited accufation 
of Louvet a gain ft Robefpierre and Marat. You 
will fee them in the next inftant, after the moft 
miferable juftiftcation of Robefpierre from thefe 
denunciations, pafs to the order of the day, and 
thus infure the triumph of the anarchifts, under 
pretence of bujying themfelves no longer about 
theje little undertakers of revolutions , to make 
ufe of the words of Barrere. Barrere, however, 
forgot, that not to punifii thefe little undertakers 
is to encourage them, and that being encouraged, 
they find in their audacity the fecret of forcing the

You will fee them, under a fudden terror both 
ot the views and the ftrength of the Orleans 
party, receive almoft unanimouflv the proportion 
made by I cuvet and Btizot, to banift the whole 
Bourbon family from the land of liberty. You 
will fee them afterwards impofed upon by a fta°- e

execution of this ialutary decree, and reftore their 
leader to the anarchifts ; for a leader they were 

ref dved to have: Chabot avowed it in the rof- 
trum. 

You will fee them (the Convention) now pene- 
trated with an holy horror at the maifacrcs of the 
2d of September. — The malfacres which were 
only the engine of the conspiracy, framed for the 
purpose of diHolving the legiflative alterably and

to the people, the ratification of the fentence of 
Louis, and then immediately yielding to calum- 
nious inlinuations, to vociferations, to terrors, to

more than any other enables us to appreciate the 
audacity of the fabtious, the weaknefs of the con-

people who pillaged, and of the people who fuf- 
tered the pillage — a crime which, of all others,

and dignity of deliberation, becaule they expofe 
the nakednefs of their entire infignificance. 

In fhort, run over all the laws of the Conven- 
tion, and you will fee the very bell: decrees,, pafled 
upon the mod' mature difcuffion, repealed in a 
fingle inftant. 

What then is the fource of all thefe changes ? 

With one Jingle Word you might compofe the 
greatefi part of the hijlory of three ajfemblies • 
This word is — FEAR. 

Fear falsified the revifion of the Confitution 9 
and occafioned its being adopted. 

Fear of Republicanifm, in the time of the legif- 
lative affembly, ranged the independents on the 
fide of the Feuillants ; and Fear has in a oreat 
meafure produced all the variations in the Con- 
vention. 

Fear does not always fhew itfelf under the fame 
charadter. Accordingly the anarchifts have the 
art to vary the form, in order the more effectually 
to excite it ; and through Fear 9 to drag man- 
kind along with them. 

To men independent by fyflem, and diftruftful 
from jealoufy, they pointed out thofe republicans 
who were the friends to order, as a party directed 
by men of deep ambition, who meant to engrofs 
all benefits to themfelves. T[ heir talents gave 
colour to the accufation ; their virtues made their 
crime the more dangerous ; order was reprelemed 
as their mafk ; the name of the law as their watch- 
word. So that the fear of wearing the livery of 
that party drove away this clals of independents 
from the caufe of order. 

To the fufpicious men diftruftful of good, and 
credulous of evil, they negligently dropped certain 

doubts, 


✓ 

( i6 ) 

doubts (which they even pretended to repel) in-, 
finuating corruption among the friends of order. 
They traced back their former connections ; they 
obferved upon their connections with minifters, 
and the conformity of their language "with that of 
the Feuillants ; and thus the Fear of treafon made 
them ready to take treafon upon truft ; and they 
refilled order from Fear of appearing to be in con- 
cert with the corrupt, and the tools of minifterial 
power. 

To men who defired to (tamp upon their deci- 
{ions the characters of principles and of exaCt juft- 
tice, and who would not condemn without hear- 
ing, nor without proofs, they faid, “ we are in a 
Jiate oj revolution and if they {till flood up for 
juftice, they were given to underftand, that fo 
much refiftance might make themfelves fufpeCted 
of being accomplices. Nam qui deliberant defci- 
verunt , to deliberate is to be guilty of treafon ; 
that is the maxim of the anarchift s. Fear of fuf- 
picion then made them to contribute to injuftice ; 
and this is the reafon why nobody has protefted 
againft fo many decrees of accufation, the iniquity 
of which time has demonftrated. Men were afraid 
of being fufpeCted as accomplices, and that is the 
reafon why men have flood up againft the caufe of 
order ; after that the anarchifts had found out the 
fecret to render order odious, by tranflating it into 
a term fynonimous to Ariftocracy. 

There is little freedom of opinion where the 
fear of calumny prevails ; there is ff ill lefs, when 
that calumny may lead to a phyjical ajfajjination , 
as it certainly does lead to moral alfafli nation. For 
there are few men who have ftrength of mind 
enough at once to brave (I will not fay death) but 
the in&ejfantly renewed fear of death , and the daily 

torture 


( *7 ) . , .. 

torture of unjuft reproach. It is wnh this two- 
edged weapon that the anarchifts have found 
means to bring under the yoke, and to harnefs to 
their triumphant car the anjlocrats of property. 
Who dreaded phyfical affaflination, and the ^pre- 
tended independents j who dreaded a moral a naffi- 

im j%ry curious fiudy is-The progrefs of fear, 
and the ''add refs which it employs in its juft idea- 
tion ; but a mod melancholy ftudy is that of the 

mifchief it has donei , a , 

At the ovitfet of. the Convention* alnrtoft all l the 
members, difgufted and lhbcked at the anarchies 

maxims* and the infolent holdnefs of men, who 

made no Teeter of their refolution to be our matters, 
received almoft unatiimoufly every propolmon 
which tended to humble and cru(h them. At tna 
time, on arriving from his home, every deputy 
wifhed to prove to his conftituents his refpefl: for 
order, and for the equality of the departments. 
Infenlibly the members begin to go a little about, 
to hold eonverfe with the terrors of the Parijiau 
name $ they hear the blood-thirfty motions of the 
jacobin Club; they learn with horror the unknown 
! details of the maffacre of the ad of September 
They ftand in dread of the renewal of it. Above 
all , they fand in dread of being themfehes the 
victims ; they imagine that in making fome facn- 
fices, they mav appeafe the anarchifts th y 
therefore complaifant with regard to their inaccu- 
racy in accounts, and to the deficit , compla.f nt 
to the ufurpation of authority ; complaifant to ro - 

ben and murder. . , , 

The fame complaifance, together with the/uir 

that diftates it, brings over the executive ccunc, f 

D ue 


t 


( 18 ) 

the inferior adntinijl rations, the tribunals , and the 
very men who hadjhewn the greatejl horror at the 
fyjiem of the anarchifs. Every one fays to hira- 
felf, “if the Convention is obliged to capitulate with 
“ a Q an o robbers, how can / have the folly to 
“ think of contending with them ?” 

. T !fy ^°. more » they give the name of pa- 
tnotifm to thefe adts of weaknefs didlated by per- 
fonal fear. They deceive themfelves. They be- 
lieve that they have nothing but peace for their ob- 
je£t, when their real object is the delire of perlonal 
fafety ; they contend ftrenuoufly againll thofe who 
eombat this weaknefs ; and to juftify themfelves, 
they begin to 1 u lpect the juftnelsof the judgement 
of thofe who are now their adverfaries ; and they 
end by calumniating the honefty of their inten- 
tions. 

Weak men, whofe honefty I will not accufe, 
behold now, what you have done ! behold the 
abyfs into which your fatal fyftem of eternal com- 
promife and conceflion has precipitated us. If we 
are at, this moment the Haves of the anarchifts, it 
is you who have prepared, who have rivetted our 
chains. 

For what has been the frilit of your complai- 
fance to them ? The banditti have had the auda- 
cioufnefs to raife their head : from being the ac- 
cufed, they have transformed themfelves into the 
accufers ; from filent fpedators of our debates, 
they are become the judges of them. Yefterday 
: at the feet of the Convention — to-day they trample 
its dignity under their feet ; mafters of 'the Con- 
vention, through di/order, they Would extend 
their domination over all France, and eternize it by 
diforder. It is the proceeding of ambitious agi- 
tators. Rerum (fays Tacitus) potiri volunt ;

Thefe are the men who, making themielves. 
matters of the roftrum, have banifhed from it 
all wife and regular difcuflions ; who by concerted 
motions of order, have inceffantly brought on d.f- 
order ; and who have oppofed the cetuoria I lnltitu- 
tions propofed by JBancal and Mellioet; inftitutions 
which, doubtlefs, would have deftroyed all the 
influence of clamour and abufe, and have reftored 
the influence of men of real information, now con- 

demned to filence. . n 

They are the men who, fullying the roltrum 
with perpetual denunciations, have reduced men 
of virtue to the neceffity of putting themfeives on 
the defenfive ; when fuch only ought to have 
been accufers ; and who, afterwards imputing that 
very defence as a crime, have thruft afide their juiti- 
fication under the pretext of avoiding perfonahties , 
becaufe they had exhaufted calumny, and dreaded 
the refutation of it. Thus they every day vented 
fretti calamities, and palled to the order o* the day, 
when the time of juftification arrived. 

They are the men who, perpetual di&ators of the 
committee of the infpctlors of the hall , have found 
out the fecret of filling the galleries with creatures of 
their own, hired to applaud their extravagances, 
and to hoot their adverlaries; who have tolerated 
and projeaed, even within its very walls, the lale 
of the moft opprobrious publications agamit the

pfefs ; that liberty which they have not afterwards 
blufhed to violate, in order to prevent the circula- 
tion of republican and apti-anarchical journals 
through the departments. For has it ever been 
attempted to reform the abufes which, make the> 
circumference of the hall a fage of gladiators , and 
its environs the lurking places oj ajfajjtnation ? Has 
it been attempted to punifh the fo frequent impre~> 
cations, outrages, and infurre&idus of the galleries ?■ 
No ! people pretended not to hear them. This 
diffimulation affe&ed to be prudence; quod fegnitia 
crat , fapientia vocabatur , fays Tacitus. 

They are the men who, having the com-) 
inittee'of general fafety in their hands, and. al- 
ways in their hands, availed themfelves of the 
error the Affembly fell into upon the affaflina-t 
tion of Pelletier, in order to drive their advert 
faries out of that'Committee, and to take poffef- 
(ion of it themfelves ; they are the men who,, 
being matters of the Committee, availed them- 
felves of its refources to conlpire againft the 
republicans, friends of order, rather than to fup- 
prefs the ariftocrats ; who prote&ing the incendiary 
Pere Duchene and Marat, haye haraffed the wri- 
ters againft anarchy by their perfections ; who 
multiplying arrefts againft them, have never, 
in fpite pf the decrees to that effeft, given any 
account pf fuch arrefts to the Affembly ; who have 
buried every thing in myftery, even the denunciai 
tion of confpiracies againft the Convention. And 
this committee continues not only unpunifhed, 
but Lord and Mafter. 

They are the men who have been the authors of 
all the farces , that were fucceffively played at the 
bar; whether to intimidate the affembly, to impede 

them 




\ 


( ** ) 

them in their progrefs, to low difcord among 
the members, or to dilgracc and diilolve the Con** 
vention. 

They are the men who ftirred np the accufation 
of the imaginary million and a half which calumny 
diftributed among the members of weight and in- 
fluence in the Legiflative Affembly ; who were 
the authors of the petitions from the workmen 
employed on the camp at Paris, filling themfelves 
the Nation, ; and wanting to put their own indem- 
nity on. a level with that of the deputies of thofe 
infolent petitions again ft the pretended moderation 
of the Affembly, as well as of thofe humiliating 
Jeflbns which pretended fedtralifts came lb often to 
read them. 

They are the men who, after having.extorted mil- 
lions from the Convention to keep down the price of 
bread at Paris (that is to fay, after having taxed all 
France for the benefit of Paris alone) in the name 
of the fe<ftions, never ceafed to weary the Conven- 
tion with petitions to fix the price of all lorts of 
grain ; becaufe they knew that this eftablilhcd 
price would neceflarily bring on a famine, and 
that famine would neceflarily produce an inlurrec- 
.tion againft the Convention, the diflolution of that 
body, and the reftoration of Royalty. It was in the 
lame fpirit that Maury wanted the fuppreflion of 
taxes ; and it is not the only fimilarity between 
the anarchifts and the ariftocrats of the Conftituent 
Affembly. 

They are the men who, after having folicited 
thofe addreffes, thole incendiary petitions, and thofe 
infolent deputations, difavowed them, and hypo- 
critipaUy condemned them, when the Convention, 

irritated 


( 22 ) 

irritated at this conduft, was going to proceed fe- 
verely againft them ; and who carrying their per- 
fidy Hill farther, imputed them to their adverfa-

commotions , the pillages , and the burnings , which 
they themf elves advife or execute . 

They are the men who have inceflantly oppofed 
the decrees for public education, becaufe they knew 
that the education of the people is the moft pow- 
erful antidote againft revolts, and famine; and 
above all, againft the quackery of agitators; and 
education is annihilated . 

They are the men who, for the perpetuation of 
their own power, finding it neceflary to perpetuate 
diforders, have divided fociety into two clafles ; 
thofe who have fomething, and thofe who have 
nothing, the Sans Culottes and the Men of property ; 
who have excited one of thefe clafles againft the 
other; who, in order to ruin the latter clafs, 
wanted to have an army compofed exclufively of 
perfons, all of the former clafs, and paid compulfo- 
rily by the latter, and this army has been decreed. 

They are the men who, in order to effect thedif- 
iolution of the Convention, have endeavoured to di- 
vide it into two parties : while (fetting afide them- 
felves) the whole Convention has but one fpirit ; 
who have invented the diftin&ion of a right hand 
jide and of a left hand Jide ; and the denomination 
of appellants and non- appellants ; who have charged 
the opinions of the former as a crime, and a title 
for the reproach and hatred of the people ; that 
opinion fo politic, fo falutary, fo honourable to 
the people ; and who have never ceafed to raife

They are the men who, not being able to fucceed 
in diffolving the Convention by this line of demar- 
cation between the appellants and the non-appel- 
lants, have endeavoured to trench upon the com- 
plete and entire ftate of the national reprefentation, 
in pointing out twenty-two of its members 
whom they feared the moft, and loudly called 
for their expulfion lometimes, and lometimes for 
their murder ; and theAffembly, after having de- 
clared the petition againft thefe twenty-two pro- 
fcribed men to be calumnious, has fuffered, has 
been forced to fuffer, the commonalty, and many 
fedtions of Paris, to ordain with ftill more fury 
and infolence the compulfory fignature of that pe- 
tition ! The Convention has fuffered the vileft 
means, and the moft illegal, to be employed to 
force the citizens to fign. Would fuch outrages 
be ftill unpuniffied if the Convention was free, 
or if it enjoyed that power with which fuch an af- 
lembly ought to be furrou'nded ? 

But is it poffible to miftake the end, the real 
end which the anarchifts propofe to themfelves in 
their cruel earneftnefs againft the twenty-two pro- 
fcribed perlons 1 

When Cromwell vyifhed to ' get the command 
of the long parliament of England, in order to dif- 
folve it afterwards, he ordered alfo an expulfion of 
all true republicans ; who could not endure either 
a king or an ufurper. Colonel Pride arrelleil 
and imprifoned, by Cromwell’s order, fixty of the 
fiimeft members; he droye away one hundred 
more, and tfie remainder, devoted to the perfi- 
duaus Cromwell, were, in his hands, nothing but 
a machine jor making decrees, which he broke 

prefently 


prefently after, as foon as the machine thought 
of revolting againft the workman who put in iti 
motion. 

Well ! this is Colonel Pride's purge (as it was 
called at the time,) which they want to repeat in 
the Convention ; becaufe the chiefs of the anar- 
chifts expefl: from it the fame effects ; and becaufe 
they fee that the diffolution of the Convention 
would make room for the throne* which is prepa- 
ing itfelf for an ufurpef* 

If this conftant obje£t of domination and .of the 
diffolution of the Convention has been marked 
out by any events ; if there is any event which 
proves with the higheft degree of evident, on 
one fide, the wickednefs and the power of the 
anarchilts ; and on the other fide, the impotence 
and the abafement of the Convention, it is the 
forced, the commanded impunity of the confpi- 
racy of the ioth of March, the impunity of Marat, 
the impunity of the Commune and of certain lec- 
tions of Paris ; in a word, the impunity of the 
chiefs of the Jacobins of Paris. 

Is there, in faft, one man of reflexion, who 
having brought together into one view all the 
circumftances of that audacious confpiracy of the 
ioth of March, who after reading and meditating 
on that eloquent, but too delicate difeourfe of 
Vergmaud, and that profound publication of Lou- 
vet, mu ft not be convinced that the^exiftence of 
that confpiracy is phyftcally demonftrated ? With 
what art did they, two days before, bring on the 
queftion of the permanency of the Convention ! 
It offered fo fine an opportunity to the affafiins, to 
comprehend in a Angle blow, in ft Angle night, 
maffacre, all the heads of all the Re- 

Thefe

With what art did they drefs ' out, in the 
colours of patriotifm, the Revolutionary Tri- 
bunal ; that instrument, created by the confpira- 
tors, either to deter the Simple citizens who might 
otherwife attempt to oppofe themlelveS to their 
fut'y, or perhaps to deStroy by the 1'word of the law. 
thole republican deputies, who might efcape the 
dagger of the affallins ! Ferocious men ! they 
would furpafs Cromwell himfelf in cruelty ; for 
Cromwell imprifoned the members of parliament 
who dilplealed him, but he did not aSTallinace them 
by means of the law. With what addrefs did tney 
take care utterly to remove from their odious infti- 
tutiori all thofe Salutary forms, which are the 
proteftion of innocence! They would not admit 
juries. They feared that they might perfuade them- 
felves to entertain a good conscience; and as to the 
anarchifts, confcience is with them but a counter- 
revolutionary word. The affembly, however, 
refufed to violate its principle. They obtained 
their end in another mariner ; — they infilled that 
the jurors * Ihould give their refpeftive voices 
aloud in court ! — Aloud in court ! When it was 
known that this tribunal too , would have its gal- 
leries under the direction oj the confpiraPrs !— 
Aloud in court ! When it was knowm that 
this mode alone would have enabled the Convention 
to have chofen the vilejt wretches for members of 
the jury /—Is it not faying to the jurymen, “ either 
“ you" Shall perilh yourfelf, or you Shall make 
“ them perilh whom we Shall mark out to you ? 
Gaudet was not afraid to aflert this in the roftrum 

If, indeed, they can be called jurors, whom the party ac- 
cufed can neither choofe nor rejeft, and who are perpetual 
in that office— it is, in truth, a commiflion of judges. 

E amidft 


( 26 ) 

amidft thebellowings of thofe monfters. The af- 
fembly thought asGaudet thought ; it condemned 
the principle. So irrefiftible was the influence of 
the confpirators, that they made them decree over 
again, in contradiction to all principle, that the. 
jurors fiould be chofen by them, the Convention l 
without doubt that the hatred which this tribu- 
nal fhould heap upon its own head, might; ulti- 
mately return back upon the Convention.* 

The fcrutiny at once deceived their hopes. 
Good men prevailed — they were to compofe this 
dreadful tribunal. Anarchy, in its turn, trembled 
for the heads of its chiefs; anarchy was on the 
point of pal lying this Revolutionary Tribunal ; 
but the neceflity of giving the fuffrage aloud in 
court ; but the terror ipread abroad by the people 
about the aflaflins, drove away the friends of juf- 
ticeand order, who had been juft nominated, and 
they left their places to fuch men. Would you 
appreciate their value r Read the minutes of their 
proceedings; their interrogatories; their judge- 
ments. They make one’s hair perfectly fraud on 
end ! Yes, if it is a tribunal fit to make one regret 
the Baft lies oJDefipotifm , if it is an inftitution proper 
for ripening and rapidly bringing back a counter- 
revolution in favour of loyalty, it is alio a tribunal 
as arbitrary iii its forms, as abfurd, as partial in its 
proofs, as iniquitous in home of its judgements. 

It was by a iimilar tribunal that the counter- 
revolution was haftened in England at the end of 
the laft century. For the anarch ifts of that time, 
fearing alike the juries and the ordinary forms,

decreed 


( 2 7 ) 

decreed an high court of juftice, which difpatched 
the victims handed over to it, in a moft military 
manner ; which fpread abroad a general confter- 
nation and indignation everywhere. Such was the 
tribunal which was in fome meafure of fome 
fervice to Cromwell and afterwards to Charles 
the Second ! Such was the tribunal fo much exe- 
crated, as to make the people receive the expulfion 
of the long parliament with delight. 

What enlightened Member of the Convention 
has not clearly feen the fatal confequences of this 
inftitutron ? What member has not feen that it 
was the work of vengeance and of ambition, ei pe- 
dal ly at the time when Robefpierre and Lindet 
perfidioufly fuelled the lift of crimes that were 
to be fubjefl to its judgement ; doubtlefs in order 
that none of the bold writers who had combated 
their party fhould efcape their fury ! What member 
did not revolt at the thirft of flaughter which ran 
through their cruelties planned in cold blood ! 
Fury in the convulfions of the face, criminality 
in the eyes^ arrogance in the tone of voice ; — is 
Hot this the pi&ure of Robefpierre ? The indig- 
nation was univerfal ; but the confpirators were 
abfolutdy mafters, and filence became a matter 
of neceflity. 

Did not their defpotifm difplay itfelf with ftill 
more audacity in the nomination of commiffioners, 
whom they lent into many departments among 
themfelves wittnan impudence beyond all belief? 
Did they not violate all the ufual forms in the no- 
minations ? Did they not publicly exclude all 
appellants as fo many traitors ? and if they art- 
fully flipped into their fcandalous lift the names 
of refpedtable men, who had no participation 

E 2 in 




( ) 

in their opinion, nor in their crimes, was it not 
done for the fake of impoiing on the refpedable 
part of the departments, and to give fome autho- 
rity and weight to their arbitrary and tyrannic de- 
cifioMs ? Decifions in which thofe refpedable men 
could have no influence, fince they were always 
in the minority in every commiffion N 

Ah ! what was the objed of thefe commiffions ? 
The neceffity of impofing upon the departments 
V 1 regard to the views of the con {piracy.; of irri- 
tating them againft the deputies, the friends of 
order, to juftify the aflaffi nation of thofe depu- 
ties. It was the fame objed, which had dic- 
tated the decree, by which the deputies were 
prohibited from writing journals. They hoped to 
exterminate or render thofe inadive who remained 
under their power ; they hoped to frighten all the 
journal writers out of the Convention. — A narrow 
computation of little- confpirators ! They knew 
not that a revolutipo, at all times and in all places, 
brings out men of courage, who fear not to brave 
death, in order to reveal the truth to the people. 

Since every thing concurs to prove to. an im- 
partial man, that the confpiracy of the loth of 
March had been contrived by the anarchifts ; that 
it had no other objed, than to fecure the govern- 
ment in their own hands by the maflacre of the 
Republican deputies ; that the Revolutionary 
Tribunal was only iuftituted with a view to 
flrengthen their power by terror ; that the fend- 
ing, that the choice of the commiffioners had 
no other objed, than to get the departments 
to approve of their domination : how can we 

explain *the filence of the Convention upon 
a crime, whofe objed was fo atrocious, the 


3 


( 2 9 ) 

proof of which was in the hands .of the Con- 
vention, and the authors of which publicly 
avowed themfelves ? How can we avoid conclu- 
ding, that thisfilence was commanded by the men 
who ruled the allembly, and who were themfelves 
dipped in the confpiracy ; by thofe w>ho, after 
having propofed it to the Jacobins, came then 
coldly to watch over the execution of it, in 
the bofom of the Convention ; by thofe who 
complained bitterly that their victims did not give 
themfelves up complaifantly at the place of facri- 
fice ; by thole, who after having fhared the de- 
partments among themfelves, wanted alfo to lhare 
the adminiftration ? That admin ill ration .which, 
they would have ufurped, had it not been for the 
courageous, difcourfe of Lareveiliere Lepaux ; had 
k not been for the fteady refiftance of Bancal ! 
That adipiniliration which the chiefs of the con- 
Ipirators then affeited to defpife, becaufe even 
their own people had feen through their fecret; 
that adminiftration, which they have fmce found 
the means to appropriate to themfelves under 
another form \—for ambitious men twijl and turn , , 
but never abandon their object. In a word, what 
c.onclufion can be drawn from all thefe fails, but 
that the Convention is under the yoke of thefe 
very confpirators? 

Has not the laft triumph of Marat brought this 
truth to full proof? What ! that man whofe foul 
is all kneaded up of blood and dirt ; that man', the 
difgrace of the revolution, and of humanity , \ who 
polluting the Convention by his prefence,, and 
degrading it every day by his excefles, . has done 
more hurt to the eftablilhment o'f the repubUf than

ariftocratical and monarchical language : certainly 
very much to be condemned, which, without 
doubt, delerved punifhment, but which the law 
never intended ro punifh with death. 

And this man is carried in triumph into the 
jnidft of the Convention itfelf, which he came 
ftill farther to outrage ! He appears there as a 
conqueror ! and Damon called thi* day of mourn- 
ing for virtue and liberty, a beautiful day ! Oflelin 
demanded the infertion of that fcandalous judge- 
ment in the bulletin of the day ! and the aflembly

hundred members, who, for the moft part, were 
qom poled of the protectors of Marat, or of thofe 
protected bv him, and that aflembly) flood dumb, 
(jilmayed, lhutting their eyes upon the prevarica- 
tion, the violation of the law, and the outrages 
done to the national reprefentation. 

I now put it to every man of candour, where is 
the fupreme authority at this moment lodged ? Is 
it in the Convention, or in the Revolutionary Tri- 
bunal ? Is it in that tribunal, or in Marat ? Is it 
in Marat, or in tbq factious band which protects 
him ? 

Oh (hatne! oh grief! Marat above the Con* 
vention ! What enemy of France has not been 
intoxicated with this fcandalous triumph ? What 
republican has not been wounded to the foul, and 
has not defpaired of liberty ? What man has not 
faid to himfelf, no, the Convention is not free ; 
were it free, it would not have fuftered itleif to 
have been difhonoured by fuch enormous crimes ; 
were it free, it would have lufpended the court, 
and brought the members of it to trial for. having 
outraged juftice, and the reprefentation ofthefove- 
teignty? 

Is 

' t 


( p ) 

Is it not farther the fad conclufion that muft be 
drawn, when we bring to mind all the ufurpationS 
of power, and all the violations of law, of which 
the municipality and the fictions of Paris have 
been conftantly rendering themfelves guilty fince 
* ' e -^riguft, and which have always re- 

mained unpumflied ? For which of the laws is it 
that they carried into execution ? 

When the late municipality is feen in the face 
of the legiflauve affembly to arrogate the fupreme 
power to itfelf, to cafhier the department, to give 
a name to the new one, then to take away all 
power of aflion from it ; to refute all correlpon- 
dence : with the mmifter of the interior, to open a 
correfpondence with all the municipalities* to lend 
about commiffioners every where, in order to 
gather the whole nation round about its car,: td 
dilobey the decree which ordained the oivino- in 
the public accounts, to difobey the decree which 
ordered the eleftion of a new municipality, and 

even to force the affembly to re-commit their 
decree : 


hen one fees the fe&ions, participating in this 
delirium, give their committees a right to arreft 
the citizens, multiply thefe arrefts to a frightful 
degree, make laws upon the mode of nomination, 
and perfevere in fpite of the decrees in the mode 
of eiedton, by a poll inftead- of a ballot : 

When one' fees the new municipality follow 
the errors of the old one, in contempt of the 
iQverejgnty of the people, arrogate to itfelf the right 
of expelling the members who difpieafed them; . 
torce .by a ihoufand vexations the mayor, whofe 
principles were a reftraint upon them, to give in. 

~ an ^ the organization of tho 

public force, in fpite of ten decrees, becaufe that 

force 


( 33 ) 

force might in the end proteCt the execution of the 
law : 

When one fees that municipality command the 
national reprefentation, to facrifice enormous and 
perpetual fums of money, fometimes to re-imburfe 
letters of credit, fometimes for the fupplies of 
corn and bread, and fometimes for the expence of 
the police : 

When one fees a Angle committee, in fpite of 
the commune, the feCtions, the Convention, fe- 
fufe to account for enormous fums dilapidated , and 
the members of the committee not only remaining 
' unpunijhed , but even fitting in the bofom of the Con- 

vention , but daring even to accufe the mojl virtuous 
men: 

When one fees this municipality, in fpite of 
decrees, fhut the barriers and the play-houfes at 
their pleafure, forbid fuch or fuch pieces, fuch or 
fuch journals, order to their bar the deputies, ge- 
nerals, and minifters, enjoin them to difmifs cer- 
tain fubaltern functionaries, and fend inquifito- 
rial commiffioners to their houfes to watch over 
the execution of their decrees : 

When one fees this municipality make laws 
upon the recruiting fervice, upon the certificates 
of civifm, changing at every moment the form of 
them, eftablifh them, annul them again, then 
allow them only to fuch as had figned the petition 
againft the twenty-two proferibed deputies, or 
only to fuch as had the approbation of the popular 
focieties, and thus by their own authority conjlitute 
thefe focieties in a corporate capacity : 

When one fees this municipality at length info- 
lently demand of the Convention, whether it is in 
a ftate to preferve the public weal, openly avow 

F the 




( 34 ) 

the defign of re-placing the Convention, declare 
itftlf in a ftate of iniurredion againft the Con- 
vention, encourage the moft atrocious calumnies 
againft its members, in its own bofom form a 
central committee for all the municipalities, and 
call to its affiftance troops from different depart- 
ments : b . .. 

In feeing this chain of criminal acts, and the 
impunity of them, fo much audacity on one fide, 
and fo much weaknefs on the other, it is impoflible 
that the citizens of the departments, and that all 
foreigners, ftiould not conclude either that the na- 
tional reprefentation lies in the commune of Paris , 
or that that commune is fuperior to it , fince the 
Convention is neither at liberty to make a decree 
againft the committee, nor has power to enforce 
the execution of its own decrees. 

What do I fay ? No ! it is not in the com- 
monalty of Paris that the exercife of the national 
fovereignty refides. It refides in a club , or rather 
in a ' [core of thofe robbers who direB that club ; 
who oblige all the authorities that are conftituted 
by the nations, to bend under them. 

It is there, it is in that club where the anarchifts 
of the Convention domineer. It is therethat the 
decrees are fabricated which are to come upon 
them with the force of a command. It is there, that 
under the title of petitions or addreffes, orders are 
fabricated which are intimated to them. It is in 
that warehoufe of, calumny, that they every day 
diforganize every thing, the miniftry, the admi- 
niftrations, and the army. It is from thence that 
the deputies, the minifters, and the generals, are 
called upon to make their appearance before them, 
and humbly bend the knee. It is there that they 
-give in their accounts, that they make their 

anfwers 



( 35 ) 

aftfwers to the denunciations againft them. It is 
there they pay obedience to the decrees of the 
club, who expel or condemn their fubalterns. 
It is there that, occupied in accufing the Girondins 
of governing every thing, and of ufurping every 
thing, the leaders of the club, drawing to them- 
felves all authority, govern all, carry off all money, 
bargains, places, commiffions, nominations to 
tribunals, &c. &c. 

It is from thence, that the orders go to 
the revolutionary tribunal, to adjourn, to 
condemn, or acquit. It is there that the ac- 
cufer of this tribunal complains that blood is not 
fhed in fufficient abundance. It is there that the 
jurymen of this tribunal promife very foon to 
bring to the fcaffold the heads of thofe deputies 
who are enemies to the Jacobins. It is there that 
they make it a fport to trample the decrees under 
foot ; to outrage the Convention, whofe appellant 
deputies they make it a point of confcience to en- 
courage themfelves in poignarding. It is there, 
that to ehgage the mob to maflacres, they corrupt 
the morality of the people; they preach up the 
neceffity of levelling all fortunes and all perfons, 
and to carry every where the fey the of equality. 
It is from thence that originate the numberlefs 
writings which tend to low the fame principles, 
the fame hatred, the fame feditions in the de- 
partments. It is from thence that the emilfaries, 
who go about preaching the war of the Sans 
Culottes againft the people of property, &c. &c, 
are commiflioned and paid. 

Every day, every night, are witnefles of thefe 
atrocious enterprifes. Every night the fpirit of 
the people is irritated, and exafperated againft the 
Convention. Every night men go to bed with 

F 2 rage. 


( 3 6 ) 

rage in their hearts, fwearing to exterminate the 
enemies of the Jacobins. Upon their return to 
their homes, in their family, in their warehoufe, 
in their fedtions, the Ample and credulous arti- 
fan communicates to every thing around him 
the contagion with which he is himfelf infe&ed. 
It is thus that the public fpirit is fucceffivdy 
poifoned, and that the feditious heat themfelves 
upon daily calumnies. 

Yet 1 afk any man who has ftudied the bafis of 
republics, can it exift at the fide of fo aftive a 
focus of confpirators, who communicate with 
thofe of the municipality of fedions, and other 
clubs of the empire ? Can there exift a Conven- 
tion free and independent, a government and 
juftice ? 

Gaudet has faid, “ if two hundred counter-revo* 
“ lutionifts were to preach the fame maxims in a 
“ club, at the fide of the Convention, they would 
“ all foon perifh upon the fcaffold,” What have 
names to do here ? The crime is the fame, and 
that of the Jacobins of Paris remains unpunilhed. 

For in a word, who among them preaching up 
murder or pillage, or carrying them into execution, 
has been denounced, and handed over to the Tribu- 
nal ? Who among them, openly confpiring againft 
the Convention, has been brought to the fcaffold? 
What do I fay ? Which among them has any one 
dared to arrefi ? No ! Inviolability is no longer a 
privilege of the national reprefentation. It is the 
qualification of that band of robbers who violate 
this principle every day. Their ima|;e refembles 
the head of Medufa } it petrifies every thing. One 
trembles at the idea of purfuing a robber, who 
decorates himfelf with the name of Jacobin. It is 
■ i almoft 


( S7 ) 

almoft an ad of courage to be prefent at the de- 
nunciations again ft them, but they foon fall into 
the duft of the committees. 

Yes I declare, from the deep conviction ot my 
foul, that as long as there exifts no power able to 
reprefs the crimes of the leaders of the Jacobins, 
there can exift no Convention, no Government. 
All the powers are neceflarily with the Club. 
There is the legiflative body ; or rather there is the 
body above the law— above all the conftituted au- 
thorities. There is the abfolute power of France. 

I have Ihewn that the club of the anarchifts was 
the fovereign of the Convention. Since the ioth 
of Auguft it is fo of the minifters. — Follow me 
upon this new fcene. 

I fpeak not to you of Danton . Danton was the 
creature of thofe factious men ; He could not but 
facrifice every thing to them. , 

But I will fpeak to you of Roland not that 
Roland was fubdued by the anarchifts ; he made 
head againft them, even at the moment when 
with fovereign power they difpofed of poignards ; 
but his difmiffion, but the iilence of the Con- 
vention, who ought to have paid a folemn homage 
to his courage, to his immenfe labouis, and to 
his irreproachable probity ; but the abandonment 
of all nature, which ought to have been fo fenfible

Direfl the opinion of the pubfic ! Senfeles 
people ! You know not then what the public opi- 
nion is, how it is formed! You know not then . 
that it is the refult of the public confcience, that 
no power, an enemy to morality and to juftice, 
can for any length of time give it its diie&ion. 
That it governs itfelf but by the eternal notions ot 
juft and unjuft; but by the comparifon of faffs, 
of opinions, of difcuflions, of fa6ts that the cabi- 
net is Client upon ; that it governs itfelf upon the 
fentiment of enlightened men. You know- 
then, that if public opinion can be for a moment 
abufed, and go aftray, its error endures not long; 
becaufe the error is foon relifted ; becaufe public 
opinion in a free government knows no paffion, 
that is able for any length of time to keep up an 

error. . . 

Public opinion admired the Jacobins of Paris in 
1792, becaufe flie faw in them only the enemies of 
defpotifm, of ariftocracy, and of feuillantifm. The 
opinion of the public abandoned them, from about 
the end of 1792 and in 1793 ; becaufe fhe faw in 
them nothing but the blind inftruments of fadtion, 
which aimed to govern France, to level pro- 
perty, and of courfe to overturn the republican 
form' of government. It is thus we explain the 
inexplicable dearth of the Jacobin journals fiom. 
that date, and the abandonment of their caufe by all 
patriot journalifts, who had fo vigoroully defended 
them till then.* 

A minifter dire£t public opinion ! But have they 
fquandered more money than Montmorin and 
Deleffart, to voyalize and feuillantize France? 

* TranJI.it or.] They have, however, triumphed.

No Feuillantifm has had its faftion ; but the 
public opinion has continued found : and the uni- 
verfal congratulations upon the vidory of the 10th 
of Auguft have proved it. And Roland would 
have done more m three months than other minif- 
ters would have done in three years. Roland 
would with thirty thoufand livres have done what 
Montmorin and Deleffart would not have done with 
millions. If thefe principles had obtained fo 
many partisans, if they had obtained the fuffrage of 
almoflall France, they would have been indebted for 
it to Truth alone, and not to money, and not to 
uppofed hired journals. For he preached up hatred 
to thofe who had committed the mallacres, and 
all France execrated thofe who had been guilty 
of them. He preached up refped to the law, and 
all France knows that without that refped no 
I epublic can exift. Roland preached truth with 
eneigy and conftancy. That was his fecret, that 
was his fyftem of corruption, which he employed 
with the journalifts, not one of whom was hired 
y him. For the Patriot Journalifts had too much 
pride to receive money, and Roland had too much 
virtue to pay any. 

Roland is no morel* The journals have not 
changed their principles. Who then continues 
their pay ? All the treafures are at the difpofal of 
the men they attack. 

Certainly one might find among the anarchifts, 
iome who, whether they touch foreign funds, 
whether they enriched themfelves by pillage, or

for he nad not then, nor till long after, killed himfelf.

by ’other culpable means, have fquandered money 
to make profelytes to anarchy, and to pervert the 
public opinion *. Have they fucceeded? No! In 
fpite of all the efforts of that hundred com- 


* On a view of the immenfe Turns expended by the anarchifts, 
it is often afked, where is the fource of their wealth ? Our 
aftonifhment ought to ceafe, in my opinion, when we recol- 
lect the dilapidations of the comite de furveillance, the lucrative 
bargains which were made by Pache, the mayor of Paris, in 
favour of his friends ; the deficit of his accounts ; the millions 
given to the municipality of Paris, no application of which 
appears ; and the fecret funds granted to the executive council. 

What ! will any one venture to affirm, that the inconceivable 
robbery of the crown jewels has not its Jhare in feeding this perennial 
fpring of corruption ? I obferve, that Thuriot had drawn into his 
hands the management of that bufinefs ; that he purfued it 
with a fingular earneftnefs ; that he afterwards configned it to 
oblivion ; th3t Fabre d’Eglantine revived it three months after, 
and without any apparent motive; that he revived it at a time 
when the facSls were forgotten; when Roland appeared to be 
abandoned; when thofe whom he protected were ruined by 
fupporting him ; when the faction preffed Rejlout to make a 
depofition againft him, at a time when they prefled Beauvoir , 
Kolly and his wife , who were their pr if oners, to make a depofition 
•againft this fame Roland ; when they employed carefles, promifes, 
menaces, to obtain this depofition, which, joined to that of the 
falfe witnefs Gauthier, might have put Rolando’s head in danger ! 
I oblerve, that this infinuation of Fabre was made the day be- 
fore the fetting fire to the Hall of JuJlice. A fire which their 
emiftaries raifed a cry upon againft the Rolandins, as having 
been the caufe of it, in order to make away with the teftimonies 
.that were on record in the inquiry into the robbery ! 

It is the conftant manoeuvre of the anarchifts to accufe their 
adverfaries of having laid fchemes for fedition, maflacre, and 
robbery : — Return them their loan, and you never will be guilty 
of calumny againft them. 

Tranfator.'] With all the author’s earneftnefs to clear his 
friend Roland of this foul robbery and breach ©f truft, his friend 
is by no means acquitted in public opinion. — Nor does his own 
chara&er efcape from cenfure : as far as can be judged from 
pamphlets, (which are however certainly not to be admitted 
as proofs,) the public voice feems to fuppofe, that Briftot (hared 
•the guilt of Roland in this foul tranfaction.

miflioners from the Mountain difperled through 
the departments, in fpite of the circulated notes 
public and private, in fpite of the journals and 
placards, the public opinion remained attached 
to order, becaufe public opinion is incorruptible ; 
becaufe fhe confiders not the Mountain, and that 
file neither does nor can fee any thing but the 
truth under a free government. 

I return to the ministers,- who, fincei muff be 
plain, have been y and are rather the minifers of 
the Jacobins of Paris than thofc of the nation , and 
I put Garat at the head. of thefe enflaved minifters. 
Garat, whole pacific character, and whofe opi- 
nions, laid down in his journal (during the con- 
ftituent aflembly) made the friends of order hope, 
that under his adminiftration, the law would at 
laft be refpefted. What has he done? Scarce 
was he inftalled, when he openly fhewed his 
complaifance for the anarchifts in a perplexed me- 
moir upon the maflacres of the 2d of September ; 
a memoir in which he falfely paints thofe maf- 
facres as the confequence of the revolution of the 
noth of Auguft ;* in which he abfolves, he even 
Honours the criminal authors. 

A decree expels the Bourbons; and Garat, when 
the law itfelf forbad him to give an opinion, 
pays his court to the factious partifans of Orleans, 
by a turn of phrafe which difcovered his oppofi- 
tion to that decree. 

* Tran flat or.'] No impartial man can with. Monf. Rriffot 
deny, that all the fubfequent maffacres were the confequence 
of the firft maffacre of the i©th of Auguft, which was planned 
and execu el by Briflbt and his friends; nor will any man, but 
the authors of fuch a£fcs, affect to make diftindtions between the 
fame crime perpetrated at different times. 

The 




( 43 } 4k- 

The law ordered him to profecute the fncen- 
diary writers, and he was filent. 

The law orders him to profecute thofe who 
had perpetrated the maffacres of the ad of Sep- 
tember, and a culpable faintheartednefs charac- 
terifes that profecution. Yet he was not ignorant, 
he, a member of the .council, was not ignorant, 
that if there was any thing that could reconcile fo- 
reign nations to us, it was the rigorous profecu- 
tion of thofe maffacres. I know he will cite to 
me certain letters written to the public accufer, 
and fome depofitions that were colleded. But it 
-is by no means, by fuch apifh tricks, that a debt 
facred to humanity and the revolution is to be 
acquitted. 

I know, too, that he will quote to me his fear of 
expofing virtuous men, even Petion, in that pro- 
cess. Falfe and perfidious managements ! Petion 
could not be expofed but by that wickednefs, 
which would make the inactivity it had con- 
demned him to, a crime in him. Petion would 
have got out of that abfurd accufation in tri- 
umph. Petion and his friends proudly rejected 
all managements on that head. Let us fpeak 
out — Garat’s real objeCt was to wreft from 
that profecution, other men who flood charged 
in the proceedings, Robefpierre, Danton, and 
Marat. Accordingly we muff attribute the fuf- 
penfion of that procedure to their influence. 

What did Garat do befides to find out the au- 
thors of the pillage on the 26th .of February, and 
to bring them to punifhment ? Where are the 
profecutions which he has ordered ? Has he even 
ever given in his account of them, although many 
decrees have ordered him to do fo ?

The 


i r 


( 44 ) 

The, confpiracy of the ioth of March breaks 
out. What did he do to prevent it? He, who 
if he could not precifely fix the place for the fit- 
ting of the committee of infurreftion, knew at 
leaf!: by a multitude of reports and proofs, that a 
formidable confpiracy was on foot againft the 
lives of many deputies, againft the liberty and 
fafety of the whole Convention ! and when that 
confpiracy had been difcovered, what miferable 
fophifms did he not employ to perfuade the Con- 
vention, and all France, that it was nothing but 
a chimera; that the committee of infurreftion 
was a fable; when at the fame time the journals of 
the Jacobins announced to all the world, that the 
plot was aftually on foot in the very heart of their 
fociety : at the very time that even the guilty 
avowed themfelves. No! never was a confpiracy 
more evidently proved ; never had any confpiracy 
a more frightful objeft in view ; and yet the 
minifter of juftice treated it with an indifference 
which became the real guilt of an accomplice.* 
Garat endeavoured to palliate his inertnefs by 
his pacific intentions, by his defign of bringing 
the parties together, and by that means preferving 
the public weal, 

I am willing to believe, that he was guided only 
by that motive. I am willing even to pardon Garat 
the outrage he did to good men, whofe irreproach- 
able character he is obliged to efteem, in putting 
them upon the footing of weak men whom he 
defpifes, and of profligates whom he detefts. But 
when he faw the impoffibility of being able to 
eftabliflx a durable peace between virtue and

duced the revolution of the 31ft of laft May. 

4 crime ; 




( 45 ) 

crime ; when he faw that the anarchifts perpetu- 
ally fported with their promiles, and their Ichemes 
of reconciliation, which were never followed by any 
thing but abortive confpiracies ; when he faw that 
the true republicans labour only for two points, 
provifionary order, and conftitution ; when he 
faw that the anarchifts would admit neither order 
nor conftitution, and though the fafety of the re- 
public depended on both ; Could he have balanced 
between the two parties? Ought he not then 
to have exerted his adminiftration in aft its 
rigour ? And if he had not the courage to do 
this ; if the fwords which they fometimes threat- 
ened him with, terrified his fluctuating imagina- 
tion, ought he not to have renounced his place, 
and have abandoned it to fome citizen who might 
have had firmnefs enough to make head againft 
the factious ? 

Inftead of following that line which the public 
good prefcribed to him, Garat quitted the admi- 
niftration of juftice ; but it was to exchange it for 
another place, the load of which was heavier. 
And what has he done in this new miniftry, 
which they had already found too vaft for Roland, 
and which neverthelefs Garat alone had the 
direction of for fix weeks, with the adminiftra- 
tion of juftice; which, from its extent, they 
found too well adapted to favour the defpotifm of 
a fingle man, and which neverthelefs they no 
longer chofe to divide, when Roland was not the 
pofleflor of it? This thoroughly proves, that 
party principles lean more to perfons than things. 
What, I fay, did Garat do ? Always devoted to 
the will of the anarchifts, he flint his eyes upon 
the crimes of the adminiftrative body, which they 
influenced. For has he annulled any of the feditious 

deliberations 

» 


( 46 ) 

deliberations of the commune of Paris, and of 
its turbulent fedions ? No, he bent the knee 
before them, to obtain a certificate of civifm. Did 
he denounce that department which rung the 
alarm bell upon the queftion of fubfiftence ? Did 
he denounce that formation of the army which the 
anarchifts had commanded in the department of 
Bouches du Rhone, and which at prefent may 
ierve to fupprefs their projefts ? Did he pro- 
lecute the dilapidators of the month of September, 
who never intended to give in their accounts ; all 
the proofs of which were fent him by the com- 
mune of Paris on the 1 8th of February ? Did he 
annul, or denounce that judgment of the depart- 
ment of the Indre and the Loire, which violated 
the liberty of the prefs, in permitting them to 
flop the circulation of this or that journal ? &c. 
Garat carried into the interior adminiftration the 
fame weaknefs, the fame inertnefs, the fame art of 
the fophift to juftify excefs, and to difpenfe with 
the punifhment of criminals. To what then 
muft this conduit be attributed ? To a want of 
fpirit; that is to fay, to a want of that vigo- 
rous determination of a man refolved to die rather 
than to deviate from his principles ; to that fear, 
which always offers incenfe to reigning power. 
He who dares, not brave tyrants, he who has 
carefled the feuillants, muft flatter the anarchifts. 

What does it coft to a man of fenfibility to judge 
fo harfhly of one of his fellow citizens, with whom 
that fweet fraternity which exifts amongft men of 
letters, that kind of new fenfe, that new lan- 
guage, which is well underftood by philofophers 
only, ought to unite him ? 

How .hard it is to be under the neceffity of tear- 
ing a minifter to pieces, who, as a private man, as 

a writer, 

■ s' . ' • - . v - . 1 ' ’ ' * ' ' ' ’ C 



( 47 ) 

a writer, merits efteem ! To fpeak ill, may be an 
enjoyment to a caluminator by profeffion ; it is a 
punifhment to good men who would wifh to be 
employed in praifes only, who would wifh to lee all 
men happy and virtuous. But this feverity becomes 
a duty. To be filent would be treafon. It is thus, 
I know (I have but too much experience of it) that 
a man brings burning coals on his own head. 
But what is true republicanifm, if it is not a per- 
petual facrifice of our own intereft, and our own 
tafte, to the public weal ? 

And fuch is ftill the painful fentiment, which 
afflicts me in running over the adminiftration of 
Pache and Monge. 

The purity of the principles which they profefled 
raifed them to be minifters ; and fear foon made 
them the flaves of the anarchifts. Frightened at the 
power of the Jacobins, at their eagernefs to denounce 
all minifters, and the facility with which the public 
and the Convention received them, they foon ar- 
ranged themfelves on the fide of thofe, who, al- 
moft always with fuccefs, wielded the poignards 
of calumny. 

That lazy abandoning of principle wanted 
j uftification. They have faid, they have repeated 
it, that it was the caufe of the people ; that the people 
muft be fupported. Thus they difhonoured the 
fair name of the people, to inveft with it an hand- 
ful of ignorant or wicked men, who roared out in 
the roftrums, or among the mobs. The atrocities, 
the threats of aflaffination, the cries of cannibals, 
were the ordinary enjoyment of this people . They 
have juftified them; they have gone the length 
of regretting with the P ruffian Cloots 9 that they 
had not fujficiently feptemberifed : they have had 


( 48 ) 

the bafenefs, as I may fay , to deify Marat ; and to 
glory in following his party • 

Such is the excefs of madnefs or hypocrify to 
which the people have been carried by fear. They 
are become cannibals through fear. It is in this 
Iketch you are to recognize Pache. No, I can 
never confole myfelf for having for fome time 
given fome fhare of my efteem to that man ; for 
having fo long kept back thofe attacks which 
would have deftroyed him in public opinion 
and in the Convention, fi'om fome of my friends 
who had better penetrated his real fentiments 
than 1 had. I fhall never confole myfelf for the 
fliare I had in the elevation of that man, wha is 
the greateft cheat of all the anarchifts, if he is not 
the greateft fool or the greateft coward amongft 
them ; of this man, whole reputation was made by 
Roland ; of this man, who, as the reward of that 
fervice, would have given up the head of his be- 
nefactor to his bloody enemies ; of this man, who, 
through complaifance to the factious, diforga- 
nifed all our armies ; and who for them, difpa- 
raged, and outraged the Convention, in protecting 
the feditious decrees of the fe&ions againft it. 

Ever attentive to the orders of the demagogues, 
who governed the multitude, Pache received their 
orders with fubmiffion. His offices were filled by 
thofe only whom they protected ; the places in the 
army, and the interior, were only pofTelTed by thofe 
who call themfelves Sans Culottes. The murderers 
of September had every where the preference ; all 
the bargains were for their advantage: thence pro- 
ceeded that enormous dilapidation of all the de- 
partments of the war. Pache diftributed the funds 
to the creatures of thofe who commanded the 

roftrum ; 


( 49 ) 

roftrum ; and they had the fecret of conftantly 
abfolving Pache to the Convention. Four or 
five hundred millions were laid out under that 
voracious minifter. Where are the accounts, which 
the Convention had ordered to be given in every 
fifteen days ? Thofe accounts which the minifter 
was bound to give in upon quitting his admi- 
niftration ? Bournonville , on entering upon his 
adminiftration , and after having examined the fate 
of the expence j, has declared that there was a 
fum of 160 millions , [about fix millions ferling ] 
of the expenditure , of which there appeared no 
particulars . Cambon faid to the committee in the 

r of rum, that it was impojfble to bring the expe?i- 
diture. of that department to light ; that a fpunge 
muf be drawn over it. (I copy his very words;) 
and Cambon, who has fliewn fo much rancour to 
get a decree againft thofe miferable little pilfer- 
ings, and to profecute thofe obfcure contractors, 
Cambon has (but his eyes upon the frightful 
expenditures of Pache. Fie has kept, in regard to 
him, a profound filence, while, in concert with the 
party under whofe banners he continues to ferve, 
he never ceafed to declaim againft Roland, who 
has given in his account clear to the laft farthing ; 
and while the irreproachable Roland is treated al moft 
as a criminal, Pache has not accounted for an hun- 
dred millions which he has touched ; Pache holds 
the firft place at Paris, and they give new millions 
to his aifpofal ? What is then this confufion 
of all ideas ? What is this fecret magic which 
covers the guilty by punifhing the innocertt ? — It is 
the protection of the anarchifts. 

Yes, if Roland had committed the thoufandth 
part of all that, with which Pache is to be re- 
proached, Roland would be no more : and Pache 

H fleeps 


( 5 ° ) 

lleeps in tranquillity. He fleeps, after having pal- 
fied and diforganifed our forces, and oceafioned 
our external difafters ! Do I fay, he fleeps ? He 
wakes ; but it is that he may prefide over a munici- 
pality, where they give in their accounts by 
threatening to fhed blood. 

Run over the accounts that have been prefented 
to you by the commiflaries of different armies ; 
you will every where fee through the whole ad- 
minift ration of Pache, that is to fay, the minifay of 
the anarchifts, that he has been the principal 
caufe of all our calamities. You will fee every 
where, at the Pyrenees, at the Alps, on the 
Rhine, upon the Mofelle, in Belgium, a per- 
feft concert of complaints upon the dearth of 
cloaths, of arms, of ammunition, of provifions ; 
although the Convention had decreed immenfe 
fums for all thefe articles ; although the ridicu- 
lous Haffenfrats, who, with his five millions of 
plebeian generals, is fit company for the madman 
who talked of 1200 departments, difplayed to 
all comers fuperb ftatements in which our armies 
were fwimming in abundance. 

Tou will fee the provifions every where paid 
fir two or three times over, warehoufes hired 
at an excefive price, battalions, though reduced 
to a third or a fixth, fiill paid jor at their full 
compliment. And why ? Becaufe the undertakers 
for the markets and the warehoufes, the commif- 
faries for the war, and the clerks in all the offices, 
were all the creatures of the anarchifts ; all profited 
from the dd'order ; all enriched themfelves under the 
cover of their mafquerade of rough ftern virtue, and 
their continually Theeing and ft houmgeach other. 

Such, too, is the talifman which governs the of- 
fices of the marine. It is there, more than even any 

where 




( 5 1 ) 

where elfe, that they have condemned themfelves to 
a complete inactivity ; and the hiftory and the 
caufes of that inactivity deferved to be examined to 

the bottom. ... f 

From the month of October, the poffipilit) ot 
a war with the maritime powers was toreleen. 
The diplomatic committee, and that of the ge- 
neral defence, had forewarned Monge; they had 
put confiderable fums into his difpolal ;- he had 
promifed to keep himfelf well provided on all the 
coafts ; to have the flnps and frigates all repaired ; 
he had promifed a fleet of thirty flnps of the line 
for the month of April ; he had promifed above 
ro fhips of the line to be ready to put to fea tor 
the month of July ; he had promifed to cover the 
fea with frigates, and to protea our commeice; he 
had promifed to fend fuccour to St. Domingo, 
and to Martinique : an exprefs law of the month 
of Oaober had ordered him to do all this. be " 
hold what he has done ! In the month of March 
all our privateers are deftroyed by tne Englilh in 
the channel; and the minifter at that period 
confefled to the committee that he had not a lingle 
advice-boat to protea them. And yet this very 
minifter, who had not a Angle advice-boat at his 
difpofal in the month of March, had in an impru- 
dent and culpable circular letter, publdhed in the 
beginning of the month of January, of which 1 tt 
well knew how to take his advantage to ftn up the 
neople of England againft us, this minifter had, 
I fay, threatened England to throw fifty thoufand 
liberty caps into her very bofom. In the mon 
of April our trading veffels were taken by Enghih 
frigates at the very mouths of our rivers ; our 
firms could not go into the Mediterranean without 
danger ; and yet we had a fleet tnere ot 1 5 flnps 0 
the line. 

H 2 


What 


( . 52 ) 

What is become then of that fleet which 
threatened Sardinia and all the Levant ? How 
came it that Monge has not even yet accufed the 
authors of that inaction to which that fleet was 
condemned for fome months? How comes it that 
he has not brought this confpiracy to light, by 
which the arms of France were difhonoured at 
Cagliari ? 

Hew will he juflify himfelf for not having fent 
any competent fuccour to the Eaft Indies ? For 
not having forewarned our colonies at the period 
of Decembei, w'hen the war with England was 
apparent? Flow will hejuftify himfelf for having 
deferred his fending a fleet to Martinico, when a 
decree had ordered him to do fo ? Flow will he 
juflify himfelf for having in the month of March 
ordeied the frigates c!i (patched for Martinique to 
cruize in the channel at the feafon of the equinox, 
which occafioned on one hand the failure of that 
expedition ; which, on the other hand, expofed that 
fleet to perifh, and actually did force it to return to 
port? And during all thefe delays, England, who 
■did not begin to arm till three months after us, 
lent Admnal Gardiner with feven fhips of the line 
and a number of frigates to the Weil: Indies, and 
that fleet made itfelf matter of the richefl fhips of 
our colonies. Is there then nothing here worfe 
than folly or than negligence ? Has not the per- 
fidy of fomedifguifed counter- revolutionifts in the 
direction of the marine offices, vifibly rendered our 
maritime forces incapable of activity, and deceived 
the fpirit of thofe Republicans who flattered them- 
lelves with the hopes of feeing revived thofe times 
of the Enghfli republic, where the celebrated 
Blake rendered their flag refpected, made kings 
tremble on their thrones, beat the Dutch fleets, 

ruined 


( S3 ) 

ruined their commerce, and kept the colonies in 
their Duty ? 

This is what an active, enlightened, enter- 
prifing minifter of the marine would have done; 
one who would have troubled himfelf with no 
other anfwers to the Jacobins, than grand enter- 
prifes and brilliant victories. , 

But to what then muft this incredible inertnefs 
in the department of the marine be attributed ? 
Is it owing to the incapacity of Monrge alone, an 
incapacity that he has himfelf twenty times 
confefled, and which became a crime when he ob- 
ftinately perfevered to continue minifter at a crifis 
fo perilous ? 

It is to be attributed to thefe leaders of the 
Jacobins, who directed Monge by means of 
their creatures placed under him in his office ; 
it is to be attributed to thofe leaders who, for 
a long time had declared that they would have 
nothing to do with an offenfive war, which they 
oppofed every where in order to force us to re- 
nounce it; to thofe leaders who, knowingly or ig- 
norantly were the inftruments of foreign powers, 
who were interefted to fftake our forces incapable 
of adivity, and whofe agents, whether by bribing, 
or by flattering their vanity, led thofe leaders to 
that fyftem ; to thofe leaders who, fpeculating 
for themfelves, or for their creatures upon the 
jobs in the marine, filled them with negligence or 
with roguery ; to thofe leaders who didated their 
own choice, commanded them to drive away all 
well informed men, who infefted the offices, the 
ports, the arfenals, with the men whom they 
preceded, whofe ignorance (hackled the progrels 
of the navy, or whofe wickednefs obftruded it 
intentionally. 


We 


( 54 ) 

We muft farther attribute this inertnefs of the 
marine to thofe white people of the colonies, arifto- 
crats or independents, who, coalefcing with the 
chiefs of the Jacobins, had ufurped a great influ- 
ence in the marine offices, and at their own plea- 
fure retarded the operations with regard to the 
colonies, or made them ftand totally ftill, in order 
to favour their independence, or their invafion by 
foreigners. 

We muft finally attribute it to Perigni, who 
in every thing direfted Monge ; whom Monge 
was ftubbornly refolved to preferve as his inti- 
mate, although the committee of general defence 
had denounced that man to him as an ariftocrat in 
difguife, under the form of Sans Culoterie, as an 
ex- noble, the fon of a colonift, interefted in the 
independency of the colonies. 

Thefe are the caufes of the inertnefs of the 
minifter of the marine ; an inertnefs which has 
ruined our privateers, ruined our commerce, 
ruined and humiliated France in all the feas ; an 
inertnefs which muft in the end deprive us of all 
provifions, and of all the primary articles which 
foreigners furnifh. 

You who, to keep your places, or through 
dread of denunciations againft you, carefs the 
faftious, whofe nullity you defpife in your hearts, 
whofe crimes you are acquainted with ; you, 
whofe names I do not fet down , but who are ne -

Republicans | 


( 55 ) 

Republicans 1 It is not the habit, but the foul 
which makes the republican ; It is the inflexible 
man, who purfues crime even in the moment of its 
triumph, in the very midft of its poignards who 
tramples its favours under his feet. Cato pierced 
his bofom rather than receive a favour from an 
ufurper, who would have felt himfelf honoured by 
being his friend. Cato was as much fuperior to the 
Lilliputian creatures of thefe times, as genius can 
be to ftupidity.— This is the republican ! 

I am fatisfied that I have fully proved that the 
anarchifts under the name of the Jacobins of Paris, 
of the municipality and of the fedtions, have go- 
verned, and do govern the Convention, the exe- 
cutive power, and all the adminiftrations, and con- 
fequentiy that they govern the whole empire. 

It remains for me to prove, that the fyftem or the 
anarchifts is the principal caule ot all the evils thae 
we fuffer, whether internal or external. What in 
truth, are the calamities which afflict us internally ? 

' The multiplicity of crimes. That multiplicity 
is produced by impunity ; the impunity by the 
inactivity of the tribunals ; the anarchifts pro- 
tect this impunity ; they llrike all the tribunals 
with a palfy,- either by the fear they excite, or by- 
denunciations and accufations of ariftocracy. 

•The repeated atts of violence from every quarter 
againjl property and perfonal fafety. 

The anarchifts of Paris give every day the ex- 
ample ; and their immediate emiflaries, and their 
emifiaries decorated with the title of commiflariesof 
the Convention, every where preach up this viola- 
tion of the rights of man. What do I fay ? They 
pra&ife that violation every where. For what town 
has not been witnefs to thele outrages ? W hat town 


( 56 ) 

has not been witnefs of thefe violations T What 
town has not been in mourning on account of 
them ? What town has not feen its beft citi- 
zens thrown into irons ? In what town have 
not thefe anai chills formed committees of fuper- 
intendence, and revolutionary committees, who, 
under pretext of ftriking at ariftocrats, ftrike at 
good patriots, becaufe they are zealous for order, 
and for the refpedt due to property ? 

The dearnefs of bread — it is produced by the 
fearcity of the markets, and the want of the 
circulation of grain. What is it produces this 
folitude in the markets ? What flops this cir- 
culation ?. The eternal declamations of the anar- 
chifts againft men of property, or againft mer- 
chants, whom they mark out by the name of 
monopolizers ; the eternal petitions of ignorant men 
who call for a rate upon grain. The labouring 
man fears he fhall be plundered, or have his throat 
cut, and he leaves his ricks untouched. 

The deficit of the public contributions. — Many 
individuals pay nothing, becaufe the law has no 
force ; and the law has no force, becaufe the anar- 
chifts take away all force from it ; many diftridts 
of departments pay nothing ; becaufe the example 
of Paris, and of Bouches du-Rhone is feducing; be- 
caufe they fear nothing ; neither the minifters, nor 
the council, who dare not break the administrators; 
nor the Convention, which is obliged to fhut its 
eyes upon thefe adts of federalifm ; becaufe, in 
fliort, the alignments given for this or that occa- 
fion, annihilate the return of the revenue to the 
center of the contributions. 

The diferedit of ajfignats. — They are diferedited 
becaufe they are too numerous; and they are too 
numerous, on one hand, becaufe the expenditure 

is 


( 57 ) 

is excelTive and uncontroled ; on the other hand, 
becaufe the fale of the national goods is (topped, 
and that the fale of the goods of the emigrants is 
nothing ; The influence of the anarchy caufes this 
double effeft. It is fubftantially the anarchifts 
who order, direct, and controul all the expendi- 
tures ; and on the other fide, acquifitions are no 
longer made, when men of property are inceflant- 
ly deftined to the fword of robbers, and when the 
defpotifm of anarchy caufes an apprehenfion of 
the return of the antient defpotifm. 

The failure of the adminif rations almoft through- 
out . . — The anarchifts alone occafion it, by cry ing out, 
and by making others who are their trufty friends 
in the clubs, cry out too, againft all adminiftrators, 
even the popular ones. From the moment that a 
man is in any adminiftration he becomes odious to 
the anarchifts j he feems culpable; he is denounced. 
It is the way to curry favour by adulation to that 
multitude whofe morals they have corrupted, and 
which delights in nothing but deftrudtion. 

The palfy of the adminiftrations is alfo owing 
to thofe a£ts of arbitrary authority exercifed in al- 
moft all the departments by the commiflaries of 
the anarchifts, over the adminiftrators, who will 
not participate in their refpedt for pillage and maf- 
facre. Thefe a£ts of defpotifm have remained un- 
punilhed ; and then forfooth they expett the ad- 
miniftrators will put the laws in execution ! 

Confider the department which have been able to 
chain down the fury of thefe ferocious men. Con- 
fider for example the department of the Gironde. 
Order has prevailed. The people have always 
been fubmiilive to the law ; although they paid 
as high as ten fols a pound for their bread, nume- 
rous battalions well difciplined have been fentto the 

I armies 


( ) 

armies againft the rebels. The public contribu- 
tions have always been well paid. It is that in 
that department they have baniftied the preachers 
of an Agrarian law ; it is that in that department 
the citizens have bricked up the doors of that 
club, where they teach the fanguinary do&rines 
which are every day preached by the Jacobins of 
Paris. In fhort, it is, that there, the admi- 
niftrators, men of integrity, of underftanding, 
and of courage, have braved both the poig- 
nards of calumny, and the menaces of the 
commiflaries, who are at the orders of the Ja- 
cobins.* 

The troubles of l 1 Eure , de VOrne y &c . — Thefe 
have been occafioned by the preachings againft 
the rich, againft monopolifers, by the feditious 
lermons upon the neceffity of fetting a rate on 
grain, and all provifions, by force of arms. 

Troubles of Orleans . — This town has from the 
beginning of the revolution lived in the enjoyment 
of a tranquility which has not been affeCted by the 
troubles excited by the fcarcity of corn in other 
places, although this was a corn country ; be- 
taufe the people were made to underftand the fub^ 
jeftj becaufe the workmen in the manufactories, 
the mod numerous clafs of people in that town, 
found a certain fubfiftence; becaufe the facrifice.s 
from men at their eafe were confiderable. This 
harmony between the poor and the rich was not 
among the principles of anarchy ; and one of thofe 
men, employed to diffeminate thofe principles ; 

* Trarflator.) The reader will obferve, that for this re- 
bellion againft the Jacobins, the people of Bourdeaux have 
been molt feverely punifhed, and this rich commerpui city put 
under the guardianship of the Sans Culottes.

mitted himfelf to be guilty of. 

The troubles of La Vendee.— They are owing 
to the ariftocracy ; but nothing has been of more 
fervice to them, than the difordersand the fyftem 
of anarchy. For what has more contributed to 
excite the fanaticifm of the country people towards 
their priefts, and their worfhip, than the cruelties

render the republican form of government fhock- 
ing to all men of property, and all men who live 
by their induftry, and who want repofe, than the 
preachings again ft property and peace ? Who has 
nominated that ftupid minifter of war, the com- 
mifianes employed to reprefs thofe troubles, and 
thofe generals who are incapable of concerting a 
good plan for hemming in the rebels ? Was it not 
the anarchifts ? Are not they the men who have 
pained the executive council : who have placed it 
under theguardianfhip of the committee of public 
iafety, which they have made up at their own 
plealure ; of that committee, which allowed itfelf 
to be impofed upon by idle tales, and which never 
adopted efficacious meafures ? In fhort, who 
commanded that fangumary law by which every 
rebel, taken in arms, is on the inftant condemned 
to death ? a law, which (trikes the peafant who 
has gone aflray, and who was forced, indeed, by 
his former lord to make himfelf the affociate of his 
crimes ; a law, the effedt of which foon turned 
upon our own troops, fince the rebels have not 
failed to make reprifals ; a law, the re-a£hon of 
which has been (till more fatal to our recruiting \ 
as it would have been more wife, more political, 
to have condemned none but the chiefs to death! 
In making the law general, they favoured the 
countei -revolution ; to have made it particular, 
by affedting the chiefs only, they would have di- 
vided thole chiefs from the good people, whom 
they nad led affray. How eafy too might it have 
been, to have brought back or to have reduced 
thofe people, under an adtive and fpirited mi- 
niihy, under a wife and refpedted Convention, 
w;th order every where eftabiifhed. 

The 


( 6 I ) 

The treafon of Dumourier and the other general 
officers . — I was fenfible of the ambition, of the 
immorality of Dumourier, and of his total indiffe- 
rence to the caufe of liberty. He never was fin- 
cerely inclined to a republic ; he wifhed for a 
monarchy, tempered by democratic forms, be- 
caufe that fort of government is more fuitable to 
men of great talents, joined with ftrong paflions. 
It is obferved, that even in the cafe of virtue itfelf 
joined with great talents , uniform virtue does not fix 
the people , but the man of the pureft intentions , who 
has befi ferved his country , is under the republican 
form expofed to fwallow the hemlock draught. What 
ought they to hope, then, fay they to thernfelves, 
who have talents only, and are void of virtue? 
But I will not be afraid to fay it, the calumnies 
which followed Dumourier, even in his triumphs, 
the fpirit of diforganization with which the anar- 
chifts had infedted his army, were the caufe that 
precipitated his treafon, and confequently preci- 
pitated our misfortunes. 

If the Convention do not foon pafs a law to put 
a flop to this corrofive fyftem of calumny, which 
fattens itfelf on every thing which is great and 
virtuous ; flte will foon find neither generals of 
experience at the head of her armies, nor men of 
underftanding in the guidance of her adminiftra- 
tions. There is no furer way, not only of con- 
demning honeft men to folitude, but of even 
multiplying deferters and traitors, than thefe 
eternal denunciations of imaginary treafons, in- 
vented at pleafure. How can it be imagined, that 
generals who have filled their functions with fide- 
lity, who every day expofe their lives in battle, 
ihould not feel indignation at feeing themfelves 
i marked 


( 



( 62 ) 

marked , out by the moft worthlefs wretches as 
villains ; in feeing all their a&ions, every dif- 
courfe of theirs, all their plans, mifreprefented by 
calumny, and their victories themfelves denounced 
as treafons ? At feeing thefe calumnies greedily 
gathered up by the multitude, heard without in- 
dignation by the Convention, often followed even 
by fufpenfions, with orders to appear at the bar, 
and followed even by decrees ? Muft not the 
blood of a general boil in his veins in reading 
fuch a decree, efpecially when he recollects the 
coldnefs with which juftifications are heard ; with 
what cruelty they cavil upon certain miferable 
pretended proofs ; with what favour they receive 
as truths, fometimes the dreams, fometimes the- 
treacherous report of a difcontented foldier ; in a 
word, at feeing the facility with which fufpedied 
generals are transferred to the Abbaye ? To the 
Abbaye ! — The very name of which place, in re- 
calling to memory that dreadful day of the 2d of 
September, muft freeze the heart of the boldeft 
and moft virtuous man. Citizens! anarchy has al- 
ready made Anitus’s and Cleon’s {hoot up among 
us. But where is Socrates, where is Phocion ? 
Are they not ftifled at their birth ? A republic 
ftands on bad ground, where, at its very 
beginning, the chances of a man’s fuccefs, are all 
in favour of crime and againft virtue. 

I pal's now to our exterior calamities, and I fhall 
prove them on the fame evidence, that they are all 
owing to the anarchifts. 

I do not place the war with Auftria in this 
clafs ; here we had no choice, it was forced 
upon us, we were outraged and threatened. We 
were under a neceffity of beginning that war, 

that 


( 63 ) 

that we might enfure fuccefs in it. That war 
promifed the molt happy fuccefs ; the fall of the 
houfe of Auftria, the liberty of the Low Countries, 
ought to have been the infallible confequence of 
it, if our leaders had had the prudence to avoid a 

maritime war. , 

But war with England, with Holland, and 
with Spain, has changed the face of affairs, and it 
has {topped the courfe of our viftories. Then 
what has occafioned this laft war ? There are 
three caufes of it : 

lit. The abfurd and impolitic decree of the 19th 
of November which very juftly excited uneafinefs 
in foreign cabinets ; a decree which men of know- 
ledge oppofed in vain ; a decree brought to nothing 
by the anarchifts themfelves, who had puflied it 
on with rage : it was brought ,to nothing after a 
fatal experience. ; but this was done too late, fince 
the mifchief had already been produced. 

2d. The maffacres of the 2d of September, the 
impunity of which, commanded by the anar- 
chifts, has alienated from us all the neutral na- 
tions. 

3d. The death of Louis. 

1 have already laid it, aqd I will never ceafe to 
repeat it, fince they do not ceafe to attribute the 
war with England to me, though I employed all 
my endeavours to avoid it ; thole maffacres, and 
that condemnation to death, have moll of all 
contributed to that war. Hear my proofs, which 
are not to be fufpefted. 

1 was in England at the time, fays Thomas 
Payne, in a work upon the point of being pub- 
lifhed, juft at the time of the maffacres on the 2d 
and 3d of September. 


Before 


( 64 ) 

Before that unhappy event, the principles of the 
French revolution were making a rapid progrefs ; 
fcarcely was the fatal news of thefe mafiacres ar- 
rived, but a general change was apparent in the 
public opinion ; all the friends of France were in 
mourning, every man feared to meet his friend : 
the enemies of the revolution triumphed, and 
made every place ring with anathemas and cries of 
horror againft France, and thefe cries diftrafted 
every heart. Thus, all France, the whole revo- 
lution fuffered by the proflicacy of a few indi- 
viduals. In vain was it faid that thofe who pe- 
riod were guilty perfons ; the anfwer was, 
that a prifon was as facred as an altar, and that he 
who could violate a prifon, was capable of betray- 
ing his country. 

Interrogate all the ftrangers, interrogate our 
ambaffadors at foreign courts, Cbauvelin, Bour- 
going ; they will tell you what an unhappy fen- 
fation that death made upon the minds of all 
men, while it was utterly ufelefs as to adding the 
leaft ftrength to the republic. 

Fox faid to an Englijhman , a friend to our 
principles and to our revolution: Let them be 
prevented from paffing that fentence of death, and 
I will be anfwerable to you that there will be no 
war, that the oppofition will prevail, that the na- 
tion will be with it; the enemies of France in the 
cabinet ot St. James’s want only that death to 
bring about a declaration of war. 

Read, in fliort, the numerous writings, the 
Gazettes which have appeared lince that time in 
England, in Germany, in Italy, in Switzerland. 
We are every where painted as cannibals ; we are 
del died every where, and that hatred has been - 

worth 


( 65 ) 

worth armies and treafures to the kings coalefced 
againft us. 

I have faid it in the roftrum before the Conven- 
tion, if y®u vote tHe death of the tyrant, without 
consulting the nation, you muft the next day vote 
a war againft England, againft Holland, againft 
Spain, who will not only make war upon you, but 
who will find their advantage in the ufe they will 
make of the fanaticifm of their people, which this 

death will occafion. _ ■ 

They would not believe me; and the death or 
..Louis was fcarcely known in foreign nations 
but our ambafl'adors were affronted and igno- 
minioufly driven away. This outrage was either 
to be fubmitted to or be refen ted. Our anfwer was 
a declaration of war. 

Who, then, has been the author of this war? 
The anarchifts only ; and yet they make it a crime 
in us 1 It is anarchy which has brought all Eu- 
rope on our backs ; it is anarchy which has aliena- 
ted every nation from us, which has been the caufe 
of all the reverfes of fortune we have differed ; 
and the anarchifts have the infamy to impute that 
reverfe of our fortunes to men who have laboured 
to put a ftop to thofe extravagancies, and to prevent 
thofe misfortunes. 

If, however, after having for no rational pur- 
pofe brought all Europe upon our back, they 
had manifefted that fpirit which is becoming 
of twenty-five millions of republicans, inha- 
biting a country the raoft fertile in refources ; 
if injlead of limiting themjelves to an ignomi- 
nious defence, they had conceived, and executed 
ome of thofe great expeditions which brought 

K 



( 66 ) 

all the kings of the Earth prof rate before the 
Romans : 

What a noble career then opened itfelf before 
our eyes ! 

* At the Pyrenees, Spain offered to us only 
mountains that were eafy to pafs over ; . . . 


At a diftance, and beyond our feas, the Spanifh 
eftablifhments are inhabited by a numerous people, 
who roar while they bite the curb, who wait only 
for a deliverer. 

Louifiana is a country to which we owe' great 
reparation on account of the cowardice with which 
we there facrificed our brethren. 

In the Weft Indies, the Englifh colonies which 
it was fo eafy to have turned topfy-turvy, fimply 
in putting the finifhing ftroke, to the purification 
of the government of our own colonies ; a mea- 
fure which is not even underftood by this council. 

In the Eaft Indies it would, perhaps, be diffi- 
cult to conquer the Dutch colonies ; it would be 
perfectly eafy to reftore them to liberty. 

In Indoftan, a prince overcome in battle but 
not fubdued ; terrible, like Mithridates, even in his 
defeats, even in the leafon of his repofe ; a prince

In Europe, Ruflia and Auftria might have been

fuaded the Sultan; it could alone, if they had 
not been ftupidly obftinate in loling it on toe 
rocks of Sardinia, have changed the face of the 
war in Europe.

were bound to encourage. 

England is a country on which we might eafdy 
enough have retaliated the terrors which fhe has 
at times excited among us, by imaginary projefts 
of invafiem. 

Throughout the whole commerce of our ene- 
mies, great advantages were offered to us for its 
deftruaion, without fear of a dangerous return 
of fimilar evils upon our own commerce. 

Such are the great ideas which ought to have 
been entertained, which ought to have been exe- 
cuted, fmee the determination was ; made to brave 
all Europe. Such were the projeas that men, 
long familiar with the nature of republicanifm, 
and the great effeas of which it Was capable, 
propofed to the committee of general defence, 
propofed by thofe men whom they accufe of 
having been the occafion of declaring the war, 
and of not having carried it on in a grand ftile, 
when their oppolers exerted themfelves for the 
K 2 deftruaion 


( 68 ) 

deftru&ion of all their means, or at leaft for 
rendering them all impotent. Richelieu, Louvois, 
Alberoni, had conceived fimilar projeds; and they, 
were men who could carry their pro; efts into exe- 
cution, only by a few thoufand fatellites : here 
the whole nation is in adion, to carry her plans 
into execution. 

But where were thefe meafures to be found > 
In our courage, in our love of liberty, in the re- 
lourcesofour foil. Queftioners, with narrowminds, 
read the hiftory of the revolution of Holland, and 
of the long parliament in England : behold the 
prodigies which have charaderifed thofe intereft- 
mg epochs* Has England ever been mafter of 
iuch foimidablc fleets as thole which under Blake 
and Penn fought witli Ruyter and Tromp ? It 
was, however, three or four millions of men -who 
bravely decided in favour of liberty. Here are 
twenty-five millions in arms. 

And thefe twenty-five millions found themfelves 
even in the month of January laft, polfeired of 
iufficiently efficacious means, and with more mo, 
ney than all the foreign powers ; even more than 
England, proud as fhe is of her riches. The 
French have a mafs of refources, fuch as no nation 
in the world has ever poflefTed before 5 f a mafs

which would doubtlefsly have doubled itfelf, could 
order but have been eftabliffied, for all was con- 
tained in our plan ; but they not only combated 
our ideas, but they even coalefced themfelves with 
the anarchifts, who ruined all our refources by 
diforder, in hopes of reigning by their afliftance. 

I had laid open thefe refources in my two 
reports upon England. Kerfaint had alfo proved 
them before me, and an event has proved the 
fad better than we, did. The Spaniards entered 
the country •, the frontier was deferted ; the - 
alarm bell was rung in the fouth; and above forty 
thoufand men fprung out of the earth in an inftant, 
uniting themfelves together at Perpignan. Thefe 
are the miracles of liberty. 

No, never did the Executive Council — What 
do I fay ? No, never did men who decreed the 
committee in order to cripple it, and who crippled 
it in order to govern in its ftead — No, never did 
thefe creatures of mediocrity rife to a conception 
of the ftrength of the French nation, nor of the 
effects of liberty. It was with labour that they 
(kimmed along the ground; they were not fenfible 
that the defenfive excites no eleftricity ; that the 
ofFenfive only could exalt a people who are 
impetuous, like the French ; they faw not, that

objefts, fublime and difficult defigns, were in- 
diipenfable. 

One only fear feemed to me conftantly to 
poffefs the council, which was not under the 
guardianffiip of free republicans, of whom the 

public exprefllon of Englifli happinefs. When men have 
once loft the idea of private property, it is impoftible that the 
idea of liberty can be preferved to them.

calumnies ceafe not to accufe, had not by a decree 
concerning the men of colour , acquired twenty 
thoufand native defenders of St. Domingo, where 
would that iiland have been, which was abandoned 
by the minifter ? Thus we could have ruined 
the commerce of our enemies by our numerous 
privateers, and thefe privateers of ours are deftroy- 
ed in a few days, whereas the rich galleons of Spain 
enter quietly into their own ports. 

Thus we might difturb England by exciting 
fermentation in her bofom, in Ireland which is 
jealous, in Scotland which is difcontented ; inftead 
of this, it is England which with fuccefs excites 
and favours rebellion among ourfelves. 

Thus it was in our power to ftraiten the fub- 
fiftence of our enemies by laying waffe their com- 
merce, and exciting commotions among them 
through the fcarcity and dearnefs of provifions ; 
whereas it is we who are threatened with this 
fcarcity by the unfkilfulnefs of thefe men, who, 
after having forced us to declare war, have incef- 
fantly fhackled all the meafures of the republicahs, 
and who have, and who ftill will have, the infa- 
mous cruelty to accufe them to the people for that 
fcarcity which they themfelves occafioned. 

In fhort, we, who Jhould no longer know any 
barrier except the Rhrne ; we have been obliged to 
abandon the fields in which we were victorious, 
and thofe brothers to whom we have given li- 
berty. 

# That evacuation of Belgium which has tar- 
nifiied the luftre of our arms, and obliged the 
liberty of Europe to lofe ground, is lbill the produdl 
of anarchy. This event which holds fo great a 
place in our hiftory deferves to be fathomed. 

8 Three 


N 


( 72 ) 

Three forts of anarchy have ruined our affairs 
in Belgium. 

The anarchy of the adminiftration of Pache, 
which has completely diforganifed the fupply of 
our armies ; which by that diforganization reduc- 
ed the army of Dumourier to flop in the middle 
of its conquefts; which ftruck it motionlefs 
through the months of November and December ; 
which hindered it from joining Bournonville and 
Cuftine, and from forcing the Pruffians and 
Auftrians to repafs the Rhine, and afterwards from 
putting themfelves- in a condition to invade Hol- 
land fooner than they did. 

To this firft Rate of minifterial anarchy, it is ne- 
ceffaryto join that other anarchy which diforganifed 
the troops, and occafioned their habits of pillage ; 
and laftly, that anarchy which created the revolu- 
tionary power, and forced the union to France of 
the countries we had invaded, before things were 
ripe for fuch a meafure. 

Who could, however, doubt the frightful evils 
that were occafioned in our armies by that doc- 
trine of anarchy which under the fhadow of equa- 
lity of right, would eftablifh equality of fad ? 
This is univerfal equality, the fcourge of fociety, 
as the other is the fupport of fociety. An anarchi- 
cal doctrine which would level all things, talents, 
and ignorance, virtues, and vices, places, ufages, 
and fervices ; a dodrine which begot that fatal 
project of organizing the army, prefented by Du 
Bois de Crance, to which it will be indebted for 
a compleat diforganifation. 

Mark the date of the prefentation of the fyftem 
of this equality of fad, entire equality. It had 
been projected and decreed even at the very open- 
ing of the Dutch campaign. If any projed could 
-*•’ en- 


/ 


(' n. ) 

encourage the want of diicipline in the foldiers, 
any fcheme could dilguft and banifh. good offi- 
cers, and throw all things into confufi on at the 
moment when order alone could give viCioiy, it 
is this projeft in truth fo ftubbprnly defended by; 
the anarchifts, and tranfplanted into their ordi- 
nary ta&ic. - 

How could they exp e<5t that there mould exiit 
any difeipline, any fubordination, when even in the 
camp they permit motions, cenfures, and denun- 
ciations of officers, and of generals? Does not 
ffich a diforder deftroy all the refpeft that is due 
to fupei iors, and all the mutual confidence without 
which fuccefs cannot be hoped for? For the fpirit 
of diftruft makes the foldier fufpicious, and inti- 
midates the general. The firft difeerns treafon in 
every danger $ the fecond, always placed between 
the necefiity of conqueft, and the image of the 
Icaffold, dares not raif'e himfelf to bold conception, 
and thofe heights of courage which electrify an 
army and enlure vi£iory. Turenne, in our 
time, would have carried his head to the fcafiold \ 
for he was fometimes beat: but the reafon why he 
more frequently conquered was, that his difeipline 
was fevere : it was, that his fokliers confiding in 
his talents, never muttered difeontent inftead of 
fighting. — Without reciprocal confidence between 
the foldier and the general, there can be no 
army, no victory, eipecially in a free govern- 
ment. 

Is it not to the fame fyftem of anarchy, of equa- 
lization, and want of fubordination, which has been 
recommended in fome clubs, and defended ever} 
in the Convention, that we owe the pillages, the 
murders, the enormities of all kinds which it was 
difficult for the officers to put a flop to, from the 
general fpirit of inlubordination ; excefles which 

L have 




( 74 ) 

have rendered the French name odious to the Bel- 
gians ? Again, is it not to this fyftem of anarchy, 
and of robbery, that we are indebted for the inven- 
tion of the revolutionary power, which has fo 
jnftly aggravated the hatred of the Belgians againft 
France ? 

What did enlightened republicans think before 
the icth of Auguft, men who wifhed for liberty, 
not only for their own country , but for all Europe ? 
c Ihey believed that they could generally eftablijb 
it j by exciting the governed againft the governors , 
in letting the people fee the facility and the advantage $ 
effuch ivfurreffiions . 

But how can the people be led to that point \ 
By the example of good government eftablifhec} 
among us ; by the example of order ; by the care 
of fpreading nothing but moral ideas among them $ 
to refpeft their properties and their rights to 
refpeft their prejudices, even when we combat 
them ; by difintereftednefs in defending the people, 
by a zeal to extend the fjpirit of liberty amongft 
them. 

This fyftem was at firft followed.* Excellent 
pamphlets from the pen of Condorcet prepared the 
peoplefor liberty j the ioth of Auguft, the repub- 
lican decrees, the battle of Valniy, the retreat of 
the Pruffians, the vidory of Jemappe, all fpoke in 
favour of France j all was rapidly deftrbyed by 
the revolutionary power „ Without doubt, good 
intentions made the majority of the aiTenibiy adopt 
it $ they would plant the tree of liberty in a ioreign 
foil, under the fhade of a people already free. To

Without any diftindfion in their feveral fedts and parties, they 
agree in treating all nations who will not conform their 
government, laws, manners, and religion, to the new French 
fafhion, as an herd of flaves. They confider the content with

Do you believe that the dodlrine which now 
prevails in France would have found many par- 
tifans among us in 1789 ? No ; a revolution in 
ideas, and in prejudices, is not made with 
that rapidity ; it moves gradually ; it does not 
efcalade. 

Philofophy does not infpire by violence, nor 
by feduftion, nor is it the fword that begets the 
love of liberty. 

Jofeph the Second alfo borrowed the language 
of philofophy when he wifhed, to fupprefs the 
monks in Belgium, and to feize upon their reve- 
nues. There was fefcn on him a malk only of 
philofophy, covering the hideous countenance of 
a greedy defpot, and the people ran to arms. 
Nothing better than another kind of defpotifm 
has been feen in the revolutionary power . 

We have feen in the commiffioners of the 
National Convention, nothing but pro-confu!s, 
working the mine of Belgium for the profit of the 
French nation ; feeking to conquer it for the 
fovereign of Paris 5 either to aggrandize his 
empire, or to fhare the burdens of the debts, and 
furnifh a rich prize to the robbers who domineered 
in France. 

Do you believe the Belgians have ever been

No; it is not by means which belong only to 
thieves and defpots that the foundations of liberty 
can be laid in an enflaved country. It is not by 
thofe means, that a new-born republic, a people 
who know not yet the elements of republican 
governments, can be united to us. Even flaves 
do not fuffer themfelves to be feduced by fuch 
artifices ; and if they have not the ftrength to 
refift, they have at lead the fenfe to know how to

fpecie of which fhe flood in need. 

But have we ever feen thofe fifty thoufand fol- 
diers who were to join our army, as foon as the 
ftandard of liberty fliould be difplayed in Belgium ? 
Have we ever feen thofe treafures which they were 
to count into our hands ? Can we either ac- 
cufe the fterility of their country, or the penury 
of their treafure, or the coldnefs of their love for 
liberty? No! defpotifm and anarchy, thefe are 
the benefits which we have tranfplanted into 
their foil. We have aded, we have fpoken like 
matters ; and from that time we have found the 
Flemings nothing but jugglers, who made the 
grimace of liberty for money ; or flaves, who in 
their hearts curfed their new tyrants. Our com- 
miflicners addrefs them in this fort ; “ you have 
<c nobles and priefls among you, drive them out 
, cc without delay, or we will neither be your bre- 
“ thren nor your patrons.” They anfwered: give 
us but time ; only leave to us the care of reform- 
ing thefe inftitutions. Our anl'wer to them was, 
“ No! it muft be at the moment; it muft be on 
V the fpot, or we will treat you as enemies ; we 
“ will abandon you to the refentment of the 
“ Auftrians.” 

What could the difarmed Belgians objefl to all 
this, furrounded as they were by feventy thoufand 
men ? They had only to hold their tongues, and 
to bow down their heads before their matters ! 
They did hold their tongues, and their filence is 
received as a fincere and free affent. 

Have not the ftrangeft artifices been adopted 
to prevent that people from retreating, and to con- 
tain them to an union ? It was forefeen, that as 


( 8o ) 

long as they were unable to effeft an union, the 
flates would preferve the fupreme authority amongft 
themfelves. Under pretence, theiefore, of re- 
lieving the people, and of exercifmg the fove- 
reignty in their right, at one ftroke they abo- 
lilhed all the duties and taxes; they fhut up all 
the treafuries. •From that time no more receipts; 
no more public money; no more means of paying 
the falaries of any man in office appointed by the 
flates. Thus was anarchy organifed amongft the 
people, that they might be compelled to throw 
themfelves into our arms. It became necenary for 
thofe who adminiftered their affairs, under the 
penalty of being expofed to fedition, and in order 
to avoid their throats being cut, to have recourfe 
to the treafury of France. What did they find 
in this treafury? ASSIGNATS. Thefe Af- 
finals were advanced at par to Belgium. By 
this means, on the one hand, they naturahfed 
this currency, in that country ; and on the other, 
they expe&ed to make a good pecuniary tranfac- 
tion. Thus it is that covetoufnefs cut its throat 
with its own hands. 2 he Belgians have feen in 
thii forced introduction of ajjignats, nothing but a 
double robbery ; and they have only the more vio- 
lently hated the union with France. 

Recollect the folicitude of the Belgians on that 
fubiect. With what eameftnefs did they conjure 
you to take off a retro-adtive effedt from thefe affig- 
nats, and to prevent them from being applied to 
the payment of debts that were contracted anterior 

to the union ? , r 

Did not this language energetically enough iig- 
nify that they lobked upon the affignats as a le- 
profy, and the union as a deadly contagion . 



( 8i ) 

And yet what regard was paid to fo juft a de- 
mand ? It was buried in the committee of finance. 
That committee wanted to make anarchy the 
means of an union. They only bufied themfelves 
in making the Belgic provinces fubfervient to their 
finances. 

Cambon faid loftily before the Belgians them- 
felves ; the Belgian war colts us hundreds of mil- 
lions. Their ordinary revenues, and even iome 
extraordinary taxes, will not anfwer to our reim- 
burfements ; and yet we have occafion for them. 
The mortgage of our affignats draws near its end. 
What muff be done ? Sell the church property of 
Brabant. There is a mortgage of two thoufand 
millions, (eighty millions lterling.) How fhall 
we get poffeffion of them ? By an immediate 
Union. Inftantly they decreed this Union. Men's 
minds were not difpofed to it. What does it 
fignify ? Let us make them vote by means of 
money. Without delay, therefore, they fecretly 
order the minifter of foreign affairs to difpofe of 
four or five hundred thoufand livres, (20,000!. 
lterling,) to make the vagabonds of Bruffeh drunk , 
and to buy profelytes to the union in all the fates . 
But even thefe means, it was faid, will obtain but 
a weak minority in our favour. What does that 
fignify ? Revolutions , faid they y are made only by 
minorities , It is the minority which has made the 
revolution of France ; it is a minority which has 
made the people triumph . 

The Belgic provinces were not fufficient to 
fatisfy the voracious cravings of this financial 
fyftem. Cambon wanted to unite every thing, 
that he might fell every, thing. Thus he forced 
the union of Savoy; in the war with Holland, 
he faw nothing but gold to feize on, and affignats

thoughts in their paffage to his lips. The fufpi- 
cions of a good citizen, freezes thofe men, whom 
the calumny of the wicked could not flop in their 
prog refs. 

You complain of their filence ! You forget 
then, that you have often eftablilhed an infulting 
equality between them and men covered with 
crimes, and made up of ignominy.— 

You forget then, that you have twenty times

You forget then, that you have not thought 
yourfelves fufficiently powerful to impcfe filence

much as to refled and to deliberate, was in his 
eyes a great crime. He calumniated our inten- 
tions. The voice of every deputy, efpecially my 
voice, would infallibly have been ftifled. There 
were fpies on the very monofyllables that efcaped 
our lips. 

Well ! who were joined with Cambon in com- 
manding thofe precipitated Unions ? Who ftifled 
all difcuflion upon them ? Who before-hand 
poifoned the intentions of well-meaning men f 
The anarchijls ! Ads of union feemed to double 
their prey. It was adding to the heap of their 
dilapidations. In their thoughts they devoured 
the inheritance of the people. They opened their 
throats againft every man who from regard to 
juftice would tear it from them. 

In fpight ©f their rage, Gaudet in the com- 
mittee frequently fet himfelf in oppofition to this 
fyftem ; becaufe the oppofition, which was im- 
poffible in the roftrum, was, at leaft poffible at 
a committee. I myfelf combated it, in concur- 
rence with him ; becaufe thefe fc, hemes of union 
did not feem to us defirable, but fo far as they 
were founded upon attachment and upon a reci- 
procal intereft ; becaufe in thefe compulfory ads 
of union, we faw neither that intereft, nor that 
reciprocal attachment ; becaufe we believed, that 
before we can effed an union, we ought to make 
ourfelves beloved ; to prove ourfelves virtuous and 
humane, and not robbers and murderers ; becaufe, 
s h fhort, we forcfaw the denouement of this 

tragedy v 


( 85 ) 

tragedy : we forefaw that the Belgians would 
foon be againft us, from the moment they did 
not (how themfelves for us, in numbers and with 
alacrity. 

This predi&ion was verified ; and once more 
I fay, we owe our misfortune to this revolutionary 
power, y/hich was but a defpotifm in difguife, and 
to the tyranny of commiffioners, and to the pil- 
lages, and exceffes of the foldiers. The fource of 
all has been in the fyftem and in the preponde-^ 
rating influence of the anarchifts. 

I do not however mean to difiemble the faults 
and the treafons of many of our generals, not 
that I believe they had great part in our misfor- 
tunes. 

I know, that in delivering himfelf too much 
up to his natural prefumption, hoping, as he did 
in Belgium, to fupply by fortunate accidents everv 
thing that was wanting to him, Dumourier did 
not take all the meafures that were neceifary for 
the execution of his defigns. 

I know that Miranda had not all the {lores 
which were neceffary for bombarding Maeftricht - 
that Dumourier had reckoned too much upon his 
intelligence with the patriots of that town, fince 
he wrote to Miranda that the gates would be 
opened at the third bomb ; while five thoufand 
were thrown in vain. 

I know that Vallence, wbo commanded the army 
of obfervatjon cantoned at Liege and upon Roer, 
fhould have repaired thither fifteen days fooner ; 
that the cantonments fhould have been broken 
up ; that the camp of obfervation fhould have 
been formed, and prepared to prevent the paffage 
of the Roer; that the generals Lanoul and Stin- 
gel might before-hand have been able to prepare 

another 


i 



( 86 ) 

another camp behind Aix la Chappelle : and, in 
fhort, have made themfelves fure of preventing 
the paflage of the Meufe. 

I know that all being forced, and Liege 
menaced, it was agreeable to the ftate of affairs 
to empty it of its wealth, and to burn the maga- 
zines there ; and that general Thouvenot has, 
perhaps, given proofs of his treafon in letting all 
fall into the hands of the Auftrians. 

I know all that ; but I afk myfelf how our 
commiffioner inquifitors who were on the fpot, 
who ought to have known every thing, — the 
plans for the campaign, the fituations of the 
armies, the reports concerning the marches of the 
enemy, how they came not to be acquainted 
with the formation and progrefs of that army of 
fifty thoufand men ? How they came not to take 
the neceflary means to obftruft its paffage, or to 
difpute it better, in order to enable us to empty 
our magazines, to carry away the foreign riches, 
and to render the retreat of the troops lefs difaf- 
ftrous, and lefs humiliating ? 

Talk myfelf, how the commiffioners, living in 
intimacy with Dumourier, the other generals, and 
their etat major, hearing every day the declara- 
tions of Dumourier and of his principal officers 
againft the Convention, how they did not pene- 
trate their perfidious defigns ? How comes it 
that they have not endeavoured to prevent their 
effects ? 1 afk myfelf how it happens, that 

inftead of making them known, they came to the 
committee, and to the r off rum of the Conven- 
tion, to make the eulogy of Dumourier ? How 
comes it that they declared with vehemence 
againft that fedtion which demanded a decree 
againft him ? I afk myfelf how it happened, and 
by what accident it was that, preciiely* at that 

epoch. 


r 


( 8? ) 

epoch, Roberfpiere difcontinued his declama- 
tions againft Dumourier ? Marat not only gave 
up his denunciations, but even affirmed, that the 
faf'ety of France depended upon Dumourier ! On 
that man who at that very hour w'as confpiring 
againft the republic ! I alk myfelf how, and by 
what means thole fudden eulogies, inexplicable 
to us, coincided with the confpiracy of the tenth 
of March?' A confpiracy which alfo tended to 
diflolve the Convention, and to change our go- 
vernment ? I alk myfelf how it has happened, that 
in the midft of all thefe treafons, the commiffioners 
fufpended only one general, and that general faith- 
ful to the Republic, who hadrefufed to enter into 

the coalition of the counter-revolutionifts 

general Miranda ? 

I ipfe myfelf in this chaos of enigmas. Time 
has not given us the key ; and it becomes not a 
republican to ground an acculation upon mere 
probabilities. 

But 1 will lay, that if the commiffioners, inftead 
of delivering themfelves up to their pleafures, to 
their intrigues, or to ads of authority, had dili- 
gently lludied the Ipirit of the Belgians, if they 
had given us faithful reports upon their difpo- 
fitions, if they had freely announced the horror 
this people felt at the revolutionary po r joer y the 
Convention, to be lure, would have abandoned 
that difaftrous fyftem of Cambon, which the 
commiffioners chofe to fofter. They would have 
preferred more fraternal meafures, and have fpared 
many misfortunes to France. 

Thefe are not the only misfortunes which we 

owe to the headftrong difpofitions of Cambon 

The difafters of our finances are in a great degree 
his work s and I fljould think myfelf culpable 

towards 


v. 





( 88 ) , 

the nation, which mu it he at hit en— 
lightened, if 1 did not here lay open my whole 
thoughts. 

Supplying the want of information, by a great 
activity, by an happy memory, by an imagination 
lively, but without regularity, without juftnefs, 
without judgement, and without knowledge ; 
carrying into his reafonings upon finance, and 
into his calculations, the fame impetuofiy, . the 
iame violence, which he difplays in his impaf- 
fioned controverfies, Cambon has neyerthelefs 
acquired a reputation in the finances which he is 
not entitled to ; and he has obtained a prspon- 
derancy which is fatal to F ranee. Fie owes the 
one to certain ftatements which it is difficult to 
attribute to his pen, or to his parts,, when they 
are known; he owes the other to the favour 
of the patriots, whole efteem he gained by the 
Jbrvices he did to the revolution in his part of the 
country. 

Supported by this, he arrogated to himfelf, 
as well in the legiflative afiembly as in the Con- 
vention, a kind of financial diftatorfhip ; for no 
one has more ftrongly declaimed againft a dida- 
torfhip, and no one has more frequently muiped 
k than Cambon ; no one has better known the 
fecret of bringing his colleagues into fubjedion, 
and of driving away fuch of them as were his 
fuperiors in knowledge— His genius confifts in 
one word to tffue— and always to iflue affignats ! 
Ke has augmented the mafs by above 3,000 
millions in eighteen months. But has he thought 
©f any one meafure to reduce that mafs ? Why 
has he not employed thofe that were prefented 
by Condorcet, whofe natural timidity has always 
unfortunately kept him at a diftance from , the 

roftrum ? 


roftrum? Why has he not propofed and carried a 
decree for fome of thofe meafures prefen ted by 
Claviere in 1791, who never ceafed from that 
time to lay before his eyes the cruel dilorders 
into which we muft be thrown by the fucceftne 
iftues of affignats; if from the very fir ft iffue 
of them meafui*es were not taken to reduce the 
quantity ? Why did he not propofe his loan in 
affignats, fo eafy at that time, and which would 
have obtained that reduction ? Why did he not 
prefs the file of the national forefts, which muft 
have brought back a quantity of affignats — 
Forefts, whofe incalculable wajle leflens their 
value every day ? Why, again, did he not adopt 
the meafures that were propofed to induce the 
purchafers of the national property to anticipate 
their payments ; an anticipation which muft have 
augmented the mafs of the paper to be burnt ? 
In a word, why has he difdained fo many other 
ingenious expedients_that were (hewn in the memo- 
rials of Claviere, that were too little read, of that 
Claviere from whom he wifhed to take left'ons in 
1791, and whom he wifhed to make his difciple in 
1792; whofe talents and genius he has inceffantly 
kept dormant and perfecuted ; becaufe he knew 
the man's fuperiority over thofe miferable plagi- 
aries, who lent him their narrow conceptions, 
by fuggefting to him expedients that were either 
ruinous or iliufory. 

For inftance, wherefore was that prohibition of 
fcdling gold, when the national intereft obliges the 
treafury to make acuftom of purchafing it; when 
commerce itfelf wanted it for its foreign balances ? 

What was that fanguinary law that was pro- 
pofed againft the fale of gold, but a tacit confef- 
fion of the impotence of the law ? Wherefore 

N was 



( 9 ° ) 

was that interruption of commerce with London, 
Amfterdam, and all the great towns, when France

IS 


obliged 


foreigners are fo much indebted to F ranee ? Does 
not the “circuit occasioned by this interruption, 
operate as a tax entirely to the lofs of the nation ? 

But they would proscribe all ftock-jobbing.--- 
Why, then, did not Cambon (hut up the exchange 
fooner, as Claviere has been inceffantly requir- 
ing ftnee 1701 ? it was going ftrait to the very 
fource of the evil. Why, after he had him felt 
confeffed that uock-jobbing could only be 
combated by counter ftock-jobbing ; why, after 
he had confeffed that ftock-jobbmg fo prodi- 
gioufly railed the price of fpecie, why did they 
not grant to the executive council fome millions 
for the operations, of a bank for raifing exchange ? 
fiiice it was proved, that with that facrifice, it 
might, perhaps, have made a faving of more than 
an hundred millions, ufelefsly facnfked in that 
purchafe of money, which is enveloped in fuch 
darknefs, although it may be the moft cruel and 
the moft burthenfome tax for the nation, and 
with which confequently Ihe ought to be beft ac- 
quainted. This purchafe has often been trufted to 
the hands of men who had an intereft in running 
counter to the revolution, and to the operations 
of government.* why

Why again did not Cambon employ himfelf 
in finding out means to dimiriifh the ufe of af- 
f gnats ? and for example, why did not he (who 
never ceafe'd in the rofirum to denounce the little 
dilapidators) denounce the firll of dilapidations ? 
Why did not he, who from the month of Augi.fi:, 

1792, afierted, that the accountant branch of 
the war office, that gulph which fwallows up the 
wealth of the nation, was in a frightful diforder, 
why has he not propofed meafures to cure that 
diforder ? Why has he left things to continue qui- 
etly in the fame hate ; infomuch that in May, 

1793, he, Cambon, fiill announced, that it was 
impofiible for any mah living to draw out a clear 
account of tic fate of that department ? It is, be- 
caufe, to clean thefe augean liable^ courage was 
wanting boldly to look in the face thofe anarchifts 
who domineer and peculate with impunity in that 
department ; it is, that it was necefiary to have 
the courage to make them empty their pockets ; 
it is, that Cambon not only never has had that 
courage, but that he has fince coalefced with the 
offenders ! He who neverthelefs had confeffed to 
the committee of general defence that bankruptcy 
was inevitable if anarchy prevailed, if they did 
notfeverely punilh the preachers up of the Agra- 
rian Law, of feditions, &c. 

Englifh government feize from them about five millions. 

T hey have never given in an account of this lofs to the 
Convention. At this period the treafury, directed by 
Cambon, had about twenty-five -millions of money purcha- 
fed in England, and which was expofed to feizure. What 
is become of that money no one knows. 

What is the fate of this tranfaftion P We know nothing 
of it. [Trarfator.] Pofiibly the author may have done in- 
juftice to thofe agents in London.

{ 92 ) 

At prcfent, what is the re fa It of this complai- 
fance of Gambon for the anarchifts r* Of this 
want of {kill, and want of forefight with which 
he has fuffered the accumulation both of difourfe- 
ments and of the mafs of the affignats ? 

The {till increafing mafs of afiignats—- depreci- 
ation always increafing, — the mortgage fecurity 
decreafmg in value and in quantity, — expendi- 
ture always increafing, —public revenue decrea-

impoflibility of drawing materials from abroad. — 
Fall of manufactures, — diftrefs of the labourers, 
— excefliye rife in the price of proyiiions, 
general mifery of the people, fedition, &c. &c. 

Here are the evils to which we are expofed by 
falfe calculation, and by the vicious fyftemof finance 

* Author.'] I fhould make two obfervations which have 
ftruck me in examining Qambon’s conduct. — I obferve 
that immediately the Roftrum afireXs to flatter the mul- 
titude, and every flatterer of the multitude makes me fufpeX 
his views. — 

I obferve that Cambon has never been attacked by the 
Journalifts who attack the moft virtuous men, and thefe 
managements of calumny increafe my fufpicions ; poflibly 
it is the refult of his connexions with certain perfons who 
difpofe of the pens of Calumniators who are in their pay. 

I fay nothing of the reports that are fpread upon the 
increafe of fortunes. 1 know nothing of it, and I do not 
fo eafily adopt common reports ; yet how 7 is his oppofi- 
tion to the law propofed by Buzot explained ? Who forces 
every Deputy to give in the balance of his fortune a quired 
fince the Legiflative or Conftituent AfTembly, and to jus- 
tify the caufes of its increafe. — Doek Cambon fo much fear 
the light ? Mine is ready— -The account {lands in one 
word." Nothing— and it is the only anfvver that I make 
to the epithet that he has given me- — The ally of PITT . 
]f madnefs has not then turned his head, if he has faid ,it 9 
if he could repeat it in cold blood — Cambon is an infamous 
calumniator. 

that 


( 93 ) 

that Cambon has followed : evils that a man of 
genius at the head of the finance woula infallibly 
have prevented ; always fuppofing that he had 
attached himfelf to a fyftem of order, the only 
one that is capable of eftablifhing the republican 
government, and faving France; always fuppo- 
fing he had combated that fyftem of a revolu- 
tionary power; which cannot but ruin the republic 
as well as the finances : evils of which it is ft ill 
poffible to diminifti the extent and the conle- 
quences ; if at length a difpoiition is mund to 

abandon that fatal fyftem. 

I confefs I am ftill to learn, how men hope to 
eftablifh liberty by defpotifm, or to repel their 
enemies, or to difperfe the difcontented, or even 
to diminifti their number, without eftablifhing 
order throughout. 

I am again at a lofs to know what the anar- 
chifts mean, what they aim at, by the word re- 
volutionary. 

When we afk an explanation from an anar- 
chift, he is very much embarraflfed, which is ne- 
ver the cafe v/ith his adverfary. I wifli, lays 
the latter, for order provisionally ; and conse- 
quently for the execution of the laws. 1 wifti 
to find a conftitution as fpeedily as poffible : be- 
caufe every one vsijhes to know ibe foetal con- 
trail under which he tnuft live : becaufe it is in 
that contract only, that he will find a folid 
pledge of his happineft, and an incentive to fight 
with refolution againft the enemies of his coun- 
try. 

The anarchift fays, without doubt there mull 
be order, there mull be a conftitution, but the 
time for it is not yet ceme. Well ! why not ? is 
the anfwer. 

Becaufe, 



( 94 ) 

Becaufe, fays he, the revolution is not finished, 
becaufe we have mal- contents within, enemies 
abroad, and that the revolutionary power is alone 
able to fubdue both the one and the other. 

I anfwer to the anarchifts — by what means 
will you fubdue your enemies abroad ? Is it not 
by troops, by money, and by 'provifions ? By 
what means do you propofe to have troops ? Is 
it hot when your fellow-citizens fhall become 
fincerely attached to your new government ? Is 
it not when they {hall be acquainted with it ? 
But if government does not exift, if inflead 
of liberty, nothing (hall be feen but a£ts of del- 
potifm ; if inflead of order, nothing is feen but 
confufion, how will you find men ready to fhed 
their blood to promote diforder ? How can you 
expert that the labourer can fow the earth, of 
which he has no affurance that he fhall gather 
the fruits ? That the merchant will buy and fell 
when his fhop may be pillaged ? How will you 
get money or affignats while fear makes men hide 
their money ; when diforder reduces the value of 
affignats, and prevents the purchafing of lands, 
the produce of which would augment their 
value ? 

Let us examine things at home. What is it 
that increafes the number of malcontents ? Is it 
not the fear that every citizen feels either for his 
fortune, or for his enjoyments, or for his life ? 
and by what means do you propofe to diminifih 
the number of thefe mal-contents, if you per- 
fift in that flate of violence, where every day 
property is violated, or the fafety of individuals is 
attacked ? Is it by commiffioners, who m one day 
dijlrihute more thousands oj Lettres de Cachets , 
than were dijlributed in the old times by all 
6 


/ 


v 95 ) 

the inquifitors ? Is it by an enormous creation of 
affignats, which portend difturbances beyond the 
power of calculation ? Is it by exciting the poor 
againft the rich, that you will make profelytes to 
your fyftem ? 

In fhort, be perfuaded that to continue what 
you call the “ revolutionary power' is to wifh 
the deftru&ion of the revolution. Convulfions 
in politics as well as phyfics muft have their 
term: their too long duration is mortal. 

In two words, do you wifh to have ftrength 
fufficient to overcome your enemies abroad ? 
Have order, have a conftitution. With a con- 
ftitution you will have armies. Without a con- 
dilution your armies will foon dilappear. 

Have order, have a good conftitution, and your 
mal-con tents will foon be difperfed. 

I go farther, — have order, have a conftitution, 
and the foreign powers will foon afk peace of 
you. How can yon expeffi, that in this uncertain 
and wavering Jiate in which you are , foreign pow- 
ers can confent to treat with a Convention , which 
is every day dragged through the dirt ; becaufe it 
is the lowejl difgrace to treat with ari executive 
power which is without intermijjion denounced y 
humiliated y and tottering * . 

When 

* Tranjlator .] Will any one contradict M. BrifTot, and 
sfTert, that Great Britain might 'have treated with France in 
the laft feffions, in 1792, when it was propofed in the Houfe of 
Commons to fend ambafiadors to Paris for that purpofe ? Is the 
time or the people now more fitted for negotiation ? All tbefe 
interrogatories have fince received one conclufive anfwer — The 
Guillotine . This is the refource by which they have hitherto 
fupported that fyflem, by which our author fuppofes they muft 
be ruined. ' 

It hardly feemed poflible to add any thing to the humi- 
liation of that aflembly and executive power when the 

autho r 


( 9 6 ) 

When the powers of Europe fent their am- 
bafladors to the long Parliament of England and 
'fought its alliance, that parliament, and the exe- 
cutive council appointed by them, poffeffed a 
great force. They caufed the laws to be refpedt- 
ed ; they broke, and without meeting any refift— 
ance, the mayor and the aldermen of London, 
who had refufed obedience to their decrees. 
There was an authority, there. was a force ! they 
were fure that the treaty concluded witn fuch a 
power w r ould be executed. 

But foreign powers who would treat with us 
in the aftual ftate that we fcand in , could they 
entertain a fimihir hope ? No, they fay — trance 
is divided by factions. One triumphs to-day : 
to-morrow it will be the triumph of another. 
If you treat with one, the other will break tne 
treaty. There is no liability. Let us wait for 
that {lability ; and then we will treat. 

I believe more than perhaps any other man 
does, that we have within ourfelves all pofiible 
refources for the fubjugatibn of our enemies, pro- 
vided thofe refources are well adminiftered. I 
believe that we ought not to lay down our arms 
till the honour of our Republic fhall he vindi- 
cated, and her independence confirmed and ac- 
knowledged. But I believe, too, that the objebt 
of this war, like the objedt of all other wars, 
ought to be peace : and that every good French- 
man ought to look out for the means of acce- 
lerating that event, becaufe the rnofl fuccefsful 
war always mo ft cruelly prefles upon the indigent 
clafs of the people. 

The 

author wrote. We, however, fee that they can be placed 
in a fituation far more bafe and degrading, and tar more 
removed from the poflihility of any negotiation with 
them. 


( 97 ) 

The end then of the foreign war lies In the 
end of the domeftic anarchy. Have a conftitu- 
tion ; have an energetic government which puts 
the laws in execution, and you will foon have 
peace. For foreign powers alfo feel the want of 
peace : but they want to have it folia and dura- 
ble. What oppofes itfelf-with moil force to the 
perfedting of this conftitution, and to the efta- 
blifhment of this government ? It is anarchy 
that does it, which will be fatisfied with nothing 
but a revolutionary power , with nothing but 
revolutionary meafures ; and which fulminates 
an anathema againft a conftitution, as againft an 
adt of treafon.* 

We have run through the caufes of our mif- 
fortunes ; our adtual fituation muft be looked at, 
to the end that we may be able to apply the re- 
medy. 

Here, then, is our fituation — 

. ^ nation numerous, adtive, induftrious, fer- 
tile in refources, that nature feems phyfically to 
have predefined to a republican government, by 
its facility of interior communication, and by the 
natural dependencies which the departments have 
on one another : a nation, the majority of 
which wifhes for a republic but would alfo have 
order. 


Tranjlator. ] The Anarchifts have, fince the author’s 
jrnprilonment, made a fort of code which they call a con- 
stitution. It does not differ fubftantially from the former 
delirious contrivance of the fame kind. But, whatever its 
intrinfic merits may be, it is fufpeuded as to its execution, 
by the Revolutionary Power , the Revolutionary Committees 
and the Revolutionary Tribunals ; all which are in far greater 
activity than ever. 5

In turning our attention to Paris as a center, 
there is to be feen a Convention, pure in its ma- 
jority, but conftrained in its movements ; wailed 
in ns energy j almoft always commanded in its 
lelults and determination j reckoning too much 
upon the chances of what may happen ; having 
no vigour but at fudden jerks ; excellent when ft 
purfi.es its fir ft impreffion ; but liable to fufpi- 
cions ; fubjeft alfo to be intimidated. This Con- 
vention is compofed of three elements, — of three 
parties eafily to be diftinguiihed. 

,* J he ^ rft the fworn enemy of the anarchifts, 
enlightened, irreproachable, courageous, and deter- 
mined either to die or to eftabliih liberty by order.

men who can do nothing but complain 5 woo be- 
lieve that to capitulate with crimes is the way to 
ftifle them ; put in motion by whifpers of certain 
artful men who play the part of fpies to the 
anarch ifts, and move the fpnngs of terror, ot 
fufpicion, of calumny ; directed, without daring 
to own it, by five or fix individuals, who, c*y- 
ing out again ft the arijlocracy of talents, have 
craftily arranged for themfelves a pretty agreeable 
fort of defpotifm, which they exercile, by Some- 
times capitulating and participating with the an- 
archifts, and fometimes by declaiming againft 
them, when they perceive that they are the 

weakeft. . . , 

A third party (the anarchifts) few in number, 

but who well know how to fupply the deficiency 
by management — compofed of dupes and rogues— - 
compofed of men of good lungs, who have only 
the faculty of coining pprafes, of fhouting and 
bawling, andraifing clamours and outcries, duetted 
by certain hypocritical chiefs, who talk continu- 
ally of Sans. Culotterie whilft they are affedting an 
infolent luxury ; whilft they are augmenting evciy 
day their own property, who are puppets of the 
didlatorfhip rather than dictators ; who pulh 
France towards royalty, by always talking of a 
republic, and not being fatisfied to eftablilh it, 
except upon laws of blood. . 

Galleries, where the fovereign maffacres domi- 
neer, fo well painted by the energetic Fauchet. 
Galleries defignedly familiarized, and for a long 
time, with inlolence, diforder, and vociferation, 

infulting 


( IOI ) 

infuiting with impunity the deputies of whofe 
courage the anarchifts are in dread. 

Juft at the out fide of the hall certain groups of 
cut-throats , placed there to outrage and menace 
the deputies in their paffage. 

In the gardens and the places about, groups of 
idlers, who go there as to a Ihow ; and or banditti, 
who preach the order of the day, iffued by the 
fecret directories ; and of female bacchanals, who 
talk of nothing but cutting off heads. 

Sections where, till the movement given in 
thefe latter times, by the recruiting law, honeft 
men dared not flhew themfeives ; where twenty or 
thirty individuals idle, or in pay, dictated laws. 
Sections numerouflv attended at prefen t, and con- 
fequently better, but too fubjeCt to change, making 
and unmaking their refolutions, according to the 
time, and to the humour of the party which hap- 
pens to be uppermoft. 

A people more divided in opinion than it 
appears to be ; compofed of a great number 
of ariftocrats, who fecretly defire the return of 
the old government ; who hate the republicans 
ftill more than they do the anarchifts ; who to make 
fure of their property, would defend the former : 
who to gain their beloved object ftir up the lat- 
ter ; compofed in part of men who live upon their 
induftry ; who weary of commotions which give 
no means of livelihood, let things go on, are 
willing to fee what will happen, applaud the 
friends of order in fecret, but command even 
their faces to be mute ; compofed of men who 
fincerely wifti a republic, but who are not 
numerous enough to convert the ariftocrats, to 
cure the indifferent of their lethargy, or to 
4 . conquep 



( 102 ) 

conquer the profligacy of three or four thousand 
robbers difperfed up and down in this city. 

A public force which is not organized, which 
is not armed ; to which, however, the juftice 
mud be done, to fay that they keep up the par- 
ticular police with care. 

A department that is null, or rendered paraly- 
tic, when it does not join itfelf with the anar- 
chifts. 

A municipality i entirely at their devotion, and in 
a Hate of open rebellion againft the Convention. 

A fociety of Jacobins entirely abandoned by 
all true patriots, by all well informed nien, by all 
the deputies who deferve any efteem, or who 
poflefs any modefly, a fociety which is delivered 
up to ambitious and covetous leaders. 

An executive council too much difcredited to 
be obeyed, tied down with cords too numerous 
to be able to proceed ; loaded with all refponfibi- 
!ity,< though deprived of all power. A council 
v. here the minifter who holds the mo ft impor- 
t r .t department, that on w'hich the fafety of 
i Vance depends, the minifter of war, is a weak 
ir n even in the opinion of his protectors; 
who, in fpight of his weaknefs, in fpight of 
the d: orders in his offices, in fpight of the evil 
he- does, is ftill kept in his place. 

A. committee of public fafety — in the hands of 
V; ’ h the whole power is really placed ; which 
holds the rmaiftry under its ferula, difpofes of 
every thing, nominates to every thing, without 
the I nft rdponfibility ; which is able to influ- 
ence the departments and the armies, by its com- 
miffiouers, and the fpirit it infpires into them; 
which commands the afiemblies, by its being 
the reporter, and by the terror of what they 


( i03 ) 

give to be underflood, rather than what they 
exprefs, and by that influence, which fo eafily 
transfers itfelf from things of importance to men, 
who are themfelves of no importance at all ; 
a committee plainly invented, to ufurp under 
another pame, the miniftry, which they could 
not diredtly ufurp ; a committee which can 
ruin or ferve France, according to its moral, 
or its immoral character, the talents, or the 
folly of its members, — a committee, the nomina- 
tion of which has been produced by an ar- 
rangement between the ambition, the fear, and 
the jealcufy didtated by the confpirators of the 
ioth of March, which had all of them their 
reprefentatives therein; a committee where we 
look in vain for the extenfive views, capable of 
embracing the immenfe fcene occupied by the 
French Revolution, and for that decided charadler 
which, if it does not make itfelf mailer of 
events, is never mafiered by them, — a committee 
in which there is found among fame, rectitude 
without fpirit, among others, a fort of fpirit with- 
out redlitude, and in Ihort, among a third, thofe 
who turn fentences, phrafes, and fhew a kind pf 
animation, without either fpirit or redlitude. A 
committee where the mediocrity of the doers can 
alone give us fome fecurity againft the extent and 
the abufe of their powers, but where no confola- 
tian is found for the evil brought upon us by their 
folly. 

Men of difcernment ought to judge of the 
committee by one fadt. If this committee had 
fearched for the caufe of our evils they would 
not have flopped, merely, where the fire Ihewed 
itfelf, on the frontiers, and at Vendee— they 
fliould have fearched higher; they would have 

4 found 



ta a*tc always takes place in the environs 
banditti and the female bacchanals have 
n a guard com- 
and 

who 


( 104 ) 

found that caufe in the want of a confiitution. 
They fhould have faid to the affembly, the re- 
volt at Vendee, the war abroad, the mifery, the 
exhaufted Hate of the finances, our inteftine di- 
vifions, our anarchy, all is there, all is in the 
one word, “ there is no confiitution.” . 

Obtain then a confiitution, obtain one in a 
month ; in a fortnight ; in a week if you can ; 
let it but be accepted, and all your evils will be 
finilhed. A confiitution is better than arms. 

A confiitution is better than the belt miifiona- 
ries to the rebels, better than the beft negociators 
with foreign powers, better than the beft meafures 
for checking the men who come to tyrannize over 
vou, even within your very precindts.— 

They tell of favages who cleave their fculls in 
order to cure themfelves of the head-ach. That 
is the very image of our committee of fatety. 
It dreams only of war, and of laws of blood, yet 
it fpeaks to us of negociations— children ! whom 
they amufe ! . It is madnefs or imbccnlity ltfelf to 
reckon upon a peace, or upon allies, while we 
are withodt a confiitution. ‘ There is no making 
an alliance, there is no treating with anarchy.— 
To treat with men, w'ho have not tne power 
to arreft the guilty, who infult them at their 
v door, or the women, who in fpite of their teeth, 
exercife the police of their precinct, or the Jaco- 
bines who haughtily fubfciibe their contingent of 
heads to be cut off *. 


C 105 ) 

Tyrants are not fo ftupid. Th6y treated with 
Cromwell, whom they detefted, becaufe he knew 

how to make himfelf reflected. Our caufe is 

as good as his was execrable. -Let us make 

ourfelves refpefted at home, and tyrants will foon 
be at our feet ; that is what the committee of 
public fafety fhould have laid to the Convention 
ten days after its formation, and without doubt 
it would have taken a vigorous part. 

Such are the individuals, fuch the bodies who 
play a part in the repuolic ; who may caufe its hap- 
pinefs, or its mifery. After fuch a ftate of fads, it 
is our bufinefs to fee how the republic can be 
faved. The Convention is, and alone ought to be 
intruded with that care; all ought to center in 
her ; all ought to proceed from her bolom. Is it 
good, is it free ? All its meafures will be good 
and will be powerful. Is it mattered ? The mea- 
fures partake of the nature of the men, and of the 
bodies which obtain the dominion. 

The Convention cannot fave France, except 
by eftablifliing provilional order, and in finilhing 
a conftitution. 

It cannot eftablifh order but in making decrees 
reprettive of anarchy as well as carrying them into 
execution. 

T. hefe decrees cannot be made and carried into 
execution but when the deputies fhall be fet free 
from all per fonal fear . 


who have no idea like the former guard of honour , of keep- 
ing off a mob from the hall. 

A refolution was palfed that 400 tickets fhould be given to 
the deputies for their brethren of the departments. Thefe 
women infult and ftrike all who pafs to thofe places. Do 
you recoiled the outrage done to Bonneville, author of thofe 
excellent patriotic writings ? Has the outrage been punilhed ?

This fear will never go off till the Conven- 
tion is in perfect tranquillity, is furrounded with 
refpe£t, with confidence, or at leaft with a force 
capable of making general tranquillity and the 
liberty of every individual refpected. 

The deputies never will believe themfelves free, 
but when they fhall be calmly liftened to, and 
without being hooted at by the galleries : when 
they fhall be no longer threatened (within their 
own precindts) to have their throats cut for their 
opinions t when, in order to repel thefe thieats 
and provocations, they fhall no longer be obliged 
to come to the Convention armed with fwOrds, 
piftols, and poignards ; for every deputy ts Jl ill 
reduced to that fad extremity : when they fhall 
no longer for the fake of their opinions be ca- 
lumniated, nor prolcribed as a mark for the 
fvvords cf aflaffins, in the clubs, in the municipa- 
lity, in the f eft ions : when they fhall fee the 
Convention, or the tribunals, punifh or caufe to 
be feverely punifhed, both calumniators, ring- 
leaders, and aflaffins. 

Thefe are the conditions, without which per- 
fonal liberty of opinion cannot exift, nor of 
courfe can the Convention exift. 

But, it is impofiible to reprefs the galleries, the 
aflaffins, and "the calumniation, the daring at- 
tacks of the clubs of Jacobins, * and the ufurpa- 

tions 

' * Have vcu not feen in thofe latter times, Chaumette an- 
nounce to the municipality of Paris, that he had at laft form- 
ed the committee of correfpondence with the 44,000 munici- 
palities, in fpite of the law of the 25th of October ? Have you 
not feen that municipality caufe the author of the feCtion oi 
Bon-Counfeil to be arrefted, becaufe in the name of that fec- 
tion, he came to proteft his zeal for maintaining order, and 

UlC 



tions of the municipality ; becaufe it is with- 
thefe elements that the leaders of the Jacobins 
form their army, an army neceflarily protefted 
by them ; becaufe thefe leaders are mafters of 
a real power, which not only rivals that of the 
aflembly, but even entirely crulhes it. I have 
cited too many examples. 

Guadet has propofed the only fit meafures 
that are fuitable to the ©ccafion. They go at 
once to their objeft ; they apply a cauftic to the feat 
of the evil. At every other time, and in every other 
body, nothing could appear fo fimple, fo natural. 

the independence of the aflembly ? Has this tranfgreflion 
which reflected on the aflembly, been punifhed ? 

As to the Jacobins, though there exifts a law, condemning 
to death all inftigators to murder, and the diflblution of the 
Convention ; though the profecution of the confpirators of the 
loth of March was ordered, have not the Jacobins at every 
fitting renewed this confpiracy, and provocations to mur- 
der ? I will quote an example taken literally from the journal 
of the fittings of the Jacobins, 12 th May, 1 793* 

A'military man — “ Do you wifti to fave the country ? 

“ the way to do it is, to exterminate all the wicked before they 
“ efcape ; I have ftudied the Convention, it is partly compofed 
« of wicked men, on whom juftice muft be had> and to that end, 
“ alarm-guns muft befired and the gates {hut.” (Applaufes.) 

Bentabole, the deputy preftdent, pretended not to obferve 
this inftigation to murder, and paid the foldier fome vague 
compliments. — They cried out that he is a man of moderation 
and a Feuillant. 

A citizen of Lyon calling himfelf deputy of the conjlitucnt 
authorities of this city— u People, you fuffer mifery in the 
midft of bleflings which encompafs you, and know not 
how to ftrike ! The mountain cannot fave, the public 
Veal , becaufe the majority of the Convention is corrupted. We 
muft make every thing that is impure vanifh from France. 
You can never effect a revolution, without bloodlhed. You 
would be mere children without it. The moderate traduce the 
friends of the people, but there is a method to put yourfelves 
above their calumnies, it is to exterminate the moderate.” 


( 108 ) 

Well ! The very reading of Guadet’s plan made 
thefe timid men fhudder ; they trufted* ftill to 
their palliatives ! 

Yet, (and it is a truth that ought to be in- 
ceflantly repeated,) as long as the Convention has 
not the courage to carry the ideas of Guadet into 
execution ; as long as the Convention dares not 
to order an end to be put to the ffttings of the 'Ja- 
cobins of Paris’, as long as it will not order their 
hall to be fhut up, and a leal put upon their papers ; 
as long as it declines to order profecution to be car- 
ried on againft thofe who inftigate men to murder, 
and to the diffolution of the Convention ; as long as 
it fuffers itlelf to be rendered every day more and 
more contemptible; every day to be more and 
more infulted ; as long as it leaves the open rebel- 
lion of the municipality of Paris unpunifhed, the 
Convention will not be free, fhe will not be any 
thing. She cannot fettle order in any one place, 
lince fhe cannot command it at her own door.-- 
So much for order . 

As for the Conf utation , there is no hope of 
fettling it, but in putting an end to the quarrels, 
the hatreds, and the fufpicions which excite one 
party of the Affembly again ft the other ; but by find- 
ing the fecret to hinder thefcenes of tumult made 
by the men who are averie to all conftitu- 
tions, the fecfet to have our debates calm, 
undifguifed, and mature. But is this poffible ? 
Men who love peace, imagine they always fee 
it. Such men are but too ready, completely to for- 
get the form when they are out of danger . One 
or two calm fittings reftore their hope, till ano- 
ther violent tempeft again blows it away. It is 
thus that they float in perpetual uncertainty, 
yielding, during the ftorm, and adding ftrength 

to 


I 



( I0 9 ) 

to the error of the departments, from the deiufive 
hopes they derive from every momentary calm. 
Every one fays to himfelf, reafon has had a tri- 
umph to day ; anarchy has had the worft of it ; 
let us then have patience ! They do not fee that 
the anarchifts have always the upper hand iu the 
conduct of affairs, and in important decifions ; 
and it is of thefe men that you would filence 
the paffions, in order to perfedt fuccefs in 
your million ! Of thefe men, who have lworn 
to eternize the difcuffion of the conffitution, 
in order to eternize their own power ! Of thefe 
men, who know the lecretof their own ftrengtb, 
iince they have an hundred times found that 
twenty of their people, by dint of noife, and 
clamour, and howling, have, after a five or fix 
hours obftinate debate, dictated to three or four 
hundred men, fuch decrees as they chofe ! No, 
that fort of difpute would have no end, elpecially 
if you add to the calculation on paffions, the 
chances of events, which rapidly fucceed each 
other, and which will almoft always draw the at- 
tention of the Affembly. 

In ffiort, as to the force with which it will be 
neceffary to encompafs either the Convention or 
the authorities, to whom the execution of the law 
is committed, it can be but of two kinds, moral 
or phyficah 

The moral force will be null, while there e^ifts 
with impunity, whether in the municipality, or 
in the clubs, fchools of defamation again ft the con- 
ftituted authorities. 

Every neceffary diffindlion is to be here made. 
Undoubtedly the Convention continues to hold 
the confidence of the departments ; and this truth 
deferves to be well thought upon, elpecially by 

Grangers, 



, ( 110 ) 

ftrangcrs, who are but too ready to calculate the fall 
of the' Convention, from the local degradation that 
fhe fuffers, in the opinion of thofe ftrarigers who 
foolilhly confidcr this local degradation as a national 
degradation. No, this laft does not exift, and there 
lies the fafety of France,/* For the confidence 
which the Convention is in poffeflion of through- 
out France, is fufficient to enfure execution of the 
laws, and refpeft to the members. 

Perhaps it may be concluded, through another 
miftake, that the Convention having the confi- 
dence of the departments, muft have that moral 
force which is neceflary to her for fulfilling the 
duties of her million, that confidence is not fuf- 
ficient to that purpofe ; Ihe muft alfo join to it in 
particular the confidence of that great city which 

Ihe inhabits. . . . , 

I am very ready to believe with 1 etion, who 

has well ft tidied the fpirit of Paris, that if all her 
inhabitants were united in the fie ft ions, and were 
interrogated upon their opinions in regard to the 
affembfy, they would almoft all of them vote in 
h p r favour. Flow is it then that addreffes, peti- 
tions, and arrefts, are every day ifl'uing.from that 
town, announcing to the Convention, that Ihe has 
loft the confidence of Paris? It is that honeft men 
abandon the place to the anarchifts.f VV hat is 
the refult ?— That in appearance the Convention

is at war with Paris, and has not her confidence. 
From the moment then that this war has ex- 
igence, wherein libels, placards, and addrefles, take 
off from the Aflembly that moral force which 
ought to fur round her ; whefe, in faff, (he is an- 
nihilated by ufurpation, and the rivalfhip for 
power, which is fet up by the clubs, the fac- 
tions, and the municipality, it is evident, that 
the Convention no longer poflefles the fmalleft 
moral force-, although ffe does poflefs, in appear- 
ance, all of that force with which the eighty-four 
departments can furround her. The reafon is evi- 
dent : thrs laft acls only from a difiance ; adlsonly 
by addrefles, which are laughed at, which never 
aims a blow at the robbers, and is to them no better 
than a vain phantom. 

To fupply this moral force, the phyfical force, 
the force of arms, mufi be called in to make the 
Aflembly. refpeded, and her decrees executed. 

Phyfical force ! cry the anarchifts. You are then 
tyrants : they only want that force: make your- 
felves beloved by the people, and the people will 
ferve you for a guard. 

Make yourfelves beloved by the people ! But by 
what people do .you mean to fpeak of ? By the 
people of France ? The Convention is in pof- 
feflion of their confidence. Of the people cf Paris ? 
The Convention believe themfelves to be in pof- 
feflion of it. is it by that people of robbers who 
furround her inclofure, commit outrage in the 
galleries, in the clubs, and in the deferted fe&ions ? 
The Convention would confider herfelf as de- 
graded, if fhe poffeffed the love of that clafs of 
people ; and it is againft them, and not againft 
the real people, that flie calls for a&ual force. 

But 


4 




( 112 ) 

But how is (he to procure that Force ? The 
whole of the regular military force which Paris can 
fupply, is difpofed of in the different armies. The 
Parifian guard which flays there, and which is 
honoured by that name, is too much in a ftate ot 
dependence, from its want of daily bread, and 
from their individual opinions, and from the rela- 
tion it holds with the men who put the mob 
into adtion, and from a thoufand other incum- 
brances which will not allow the Convention to 
rely always upon the fervice of that guard in 
her defence. 

Will you call for this force from the depart- 
ments ? The anarchifts will bawl out — a counter- 
revolution ! Federal ifm ! This departmental guard 
might be, perhaps, at prcfent, a pretext for diicord 
in Paris, or might be fhortly debauched from the 
Convention. 

Neverthelefs it is impoffible for the Convention 
to fave France without being free in making her 
decrees, and without fully inforcing their execu- 
tion. If flie cannot infure that liberty, that fa- 
culty, except through public confidence, or by 
force ; if the confidence of the eighty-five depart- 
ments is made null by the robbers who mfeft 
Paris ; if no force is on foot able to reprefs them ; 
if by the concurrence' of thefe circumftances, the 
Convention is under the yoke of a faction which 
governs her, and who by her means, expeas to 
oovern France in making her a mill for decrees (as 
Ifiiard exprefled it) we muft either conlent to de- 
ftroy the republic in allowing the prefent Conven- 
tion of to-day to die of a confumption in the mire, 
or a prompt and vigorous part muft be taken to draw 
her out, in order to give France a reprefentation. 

that lhall carry with it dignity, liberty, and power. 

Many 


( ri 3 ) 

Many methods have been propofol — we will 
rapidly run them over. 

i ft. To transfer the Convention to Verfailles, 
or to fome other fdace. But this tranflation will 
not remove our paflions, nor our divifions from 
us, nor will it efface the degradation that vve lie 
under. But the body of the people does not pro- 
nounce between the parties, Befides, is this 
tranflation in other refpeCls practicable ? 

2d. To convoke our fuppleants (thofe who are 
chofen to fucceed on vacancies) to another town. 
They are not fufficient in number ; and befides, 
the fenfe of the people is not taken by this mea- 
fu re. 

3d. To augment the Convention by a third of 
its members. It is the way to double the tu- 
mult; to fill the empty feats of every party, 
without annihilating the parties. This increafe of 
a third of the members would neither produce 
in their favour more liberty nor more force. We 
have members enough, who with well to liberty ; 
but there are {till more who apprehend violence. 

4th. To prefent, all at once, to the primary afi, 
femblies a plan of a committee of conftittuion 
to engage them to accept it ; and to name another 
legiflature. 

This would be the heft way if we had the 
ftrength of mind to raile ourfelves above little 
paflions, and wildom to look for nothing in this 
plan of con flit ut ion, but a meafure prefled upon 
us by a regard for general fafety, rather than a 
plan requiring minute qare to make all its. parts 
perfeCt. Without doubt it has defefts,. but it 
offers eafy means of reform when we (hall have 
peace. 

Q. 


I will 


( ”4 > 

I will not ceafe to repeat it. — Let us have a 
conftitution, and we (hall have a refpcCted legis- 
lature, laws that will be obeyed, phyfical force to 
enlure the execution of them, and an executive power- 
ref peeled and independent of the legifature , with 
which foreign powers may treat . Let us have a 
conftitution and we fhall be delivered both from 
that committee of public fafety, which is a dif- 
guftful monfter, which annihilates all refponfibi-* 
lity, monopolizes all power. We fhall be delivered; 
by the fame means from thefe commiffioners 
or defpots difdributed through the departments* 
and the armies who can anfwer no purpofe but 
that of diforganizing every thing, of driving 
away men of talents from the public fervice,* and 
of making republicanilrn odious : befides, there 
cannot be a conflitution ready, except by this 
fourth meafure. If we attempt feebly to difeufs 
it now, we (hall not have it in readinefs thefe two 
years. 

The fifth method is preferable, provided the 
fourth is not adopted ; it confirts in immediately 
convoking the primary aflemblies to. proceed to the 
election of a new Convention, with a recommen- 
dation to them not to eleCt the prefent deputies. 

This plan of Genfonne differs from that of La- 
fource ; the refult of whofe proposition would 
have been a nullity, becaufe if it were practica- 
ble to make an expurgatory ferutiny of five or

fix million of men upon thirty deputies,' who are all 
well known, it is impoliible that it (hould reach fori y 
or fifty obfcure deputies who diftiuguilh them- 
lelves only by the Bowlings and vociferations they 
make m chorus.— Thefe men ate, perhaps, more 
dangerous than the orators ; for it is they who 
fatigue the aflembly- by their cries, and carry 
the decrees by force. One of thefe two confe- 
quences would follow : either the recommenda- 
tion to exclude all the prefent members would be 
adopted, and then the new legiflature would be 
delivered from the tyranny of thofe turbulent 
men ; or, if that general recommendation (hould 
not be attended to, they are too well known by 
their excefles in their departments not to be ex- 
cluded in a new eledtion. 

This project of Genfonne is much better than 
that of Condorcet ; becaufe its execution is imme- 
diate. Condorcet does not convoke the primary 
anemones till the month of November. Either 
we are found, or we are diftempered ; if we are 
iound, we do not want the remedy : if we are dif- 
tempered, it will not come in time. 

I look for the motive which could dilate Con- 
oorcet s projedt. Could he imagine it a cure for 
the maladies which afflift the Convention ? This 
would be to lead the nation into a pernicious er- 
ror. The Convention- might perfedt a cure, if 
the were free. Is fhe fo ? Surely Condorcet will 
not affirm it. Will (he be more fo in the month 
of November? Who will dare to play with the 
lafety of the nation upon this chance ? It is how- 
ever what they do, who will, not take a meafure 
tnat is prompt and decifive. 

I like the meafure of Genfonne. It carries 
*ts (tamp. It applies an inftant remedy, be-

caufe the evil is preffing. It is an appeal to the 
French people ; to the people who ought in the 
end to pronounce between us* and our adverfaries, 
who ought to pronounce between order and anar- 
chy ; her voice alone can completely ci ufh the 
anarchifts. The people too of themfelves can 
adopt this meafure, whenever they fee the evil at 
its height. 

The meafure interrupts no bufinefs. We all 
remain at our polls. We continue the difeuffion 
of the plan of the con flit ution ; we watch over, 
affairs at home and abroad. 

The new Convention brings a change of men ; 
and that is what' we feek. Thofe who compofe 
theprefent Convention hate one another too much 
not to fight with an eternal rancour, and no public 
good is done in the midfl of that fierce battle. 

The new Convention will either change the 
place of her fitting without any convulfions, or 
even if fhe returns to Paris, fhe will come fur- x j 
rounded with a force from the departments, capar 
ble of making herlelf refpedled, and will take the 
direction of the police and of the public force into 
her own hands. 

Genfonne propofed fome time ago this meafure 
of putting the police into the hands of the Con- 
vention. It was treated as a tyrannical meafure. 

It was not even put to the vote. Time has (hewn 
the wifdom of this rejection. 

The national reprefentation mufl have the po- 
lice of the place where fhe fits, or fhe never can 
be free.* 

To decide the place where the legiflative body 
mufl refide is a great queflion. For her liberty, 

# Yet an accumulation of all power is the very deferip- 
tlon of defpotiCm. 


1 


( "7 ) 

tier independence, is the only fecurity for the 
goodnefs of her decrees, and for the equality of 
the departments. 

This queftion was long difeufled in the Ameri- 
can Congrefs, and the experience of fifteen years 
has proved, that whatever they could do, the 
difpofition of the fpot where the Congrefs refided, 
had always more influence upon its deliberations 
than any of the other ftates. This experiment 
was often made in Pennfylvania, in Jerfey, at 
New Yoik ; it has always given this fame refult. 
Hence it is, thatthere were eternal difeufiions be- 
tween the different ftates ; hence it is that they 
at length refolved to build a federal town diftant 
from great cities ; upon a ground belonging 
„ K) the Congrefs only, where (he alone might ex- 
ercife the rights of government. 

The Congrefs befides experienced another in- 
convenience not lefs confiderable by refiding in a 
great town. It was in perpetual difputes with the 
conftituted authorities either of the town itfelf, or 
of the particular ftate ; they would have a rival- 
fhip with the Congrefs. But there (in America) 
as reafon prefides in their heads, it is not violence 
that fupports thefe rivafthips ; they (hew them- 
felves only in altercations, in punftilios always 
vexatious, always too apt to alter that confidence 
which ought to furround the legiflative bodv. 

At the end of the war a great number of fol- 
diers prefented themfelves to the Congrefs to de- 
mand indemnities. The petition was inlolent. The 
Congrefs called upon the government of Philadel- 
phia for forces to reprefs the feditious foldiers. 
The government (hewed no earneftnefs ; and the 
Congrefs adjourned itfelf immediately into the 

Jerfey s, 


/ 


( n8 ) 

Jerfey.s, though no violence had been committed 
again ft it*. 

What would that Congrefs fay if it knew the 
a&ual pofition of the French Convention ? Would 
it notjuftly blame the republic for continuing in a 
town where its deliberations are not free* where 
its authority is every day trampled under foot by 
inferior authorities, where its deputies are infulted 
and menaced ? 

I do not at all examine here, whether if in time 
of peace, and when the conftitution fhall be tbo- 
roughly fettled, circumftances, phyfical and poli- 
tical, will not demand that the legiflative power 
may be fixed in Paris. Without doubt, it is not 
impoflible to eftablifh the independency of the le- 
gifiative body in that great city. But I maintain 
that the meafures which can eftablifli that inde- 
pendence of the legiflative body in any town what- 
ever, ought to be prefcribed by the conftitution, 
to the end that they may not be always counter- 
aded. I maintain that the Convention has not 
at this time in Paris, the liberty which is necef- 
fary for taking her meafures, nor the force for car- 
rying them into execution. 

There is nothing on which to hefitate. The 
new Convention muft have a provifonal meeting 
fomewhere elfe , to enable her to deliberate . 

But the profperity of Paris ! — but the happinej$ 
of the people l— What will become of them i will be 
the cry ? 1 anfwer, that without doubt, Paris has 
done immenfe fervice to the revolution ; but it 
will be paying too dear for her fervices, if we 
facrifice the liberty of France as an acknowledge- 
ment. That will be betraying the defires of Paris 
herfelf. 


The 




( "9 ) 

The republic ought to employ her care for the 
happinefs of Paris ; it is a lacred debt ; fhe will 
difcharge it with honour. A crowd of meafures 
prefent themfelves to reflore the ancient profperity 
of that city, or rather to bedow on her a profperity 
built upon a more (olid and more honourable foun- 
dation. 

But the fird, the mod: efficacious of thefe mea- 
sures is, the redoration of order and of law. For 
it is a matter of demondration, that order will never 
oe edablilhed in Paris as long as the Convention is 
ruled by the robbers who ulurp the name of its in- 
habitants, as a difguife to decorate their fangui- 
nary decrees. This people of robbers , who di fir aft 
Pans, and outrage the Convention, mufi be exter- 
minated. 

And it is to thele robbers , whom thev call the 
people, the fove reign, that our anarchids w r ould 
iubjeci all France. 

Do you believe them, (I fay as Cicero faid to 
the vataline of his day,) do you believe that the 
people of France is only a compound of thofe 
mercenaries, hired to befiege the fenate, to infult 
the magidrates, to dimulate to pillages and to 
conflagrations, and to call for murders without 
end . What a fine pifture of the dignity of the 
French people, of that people, who, even in the 
tnidft of their adverfity, are able to make kings 
tremble, together with their people of (laves !* 
Is this troop of banditti who daily furround the 
fenate; is this the French people? The true 
people of France are they, who fill our towns,

employed in our armies in defence of their 
country againft foreign tyrants. There, there is 
the people of France whom we wilh to ferve, 
whole intereft ought to prevail with us above all 
things ! There is the people who wifh that their 
representatives ftiould be free, in order that they 
may give them falutary laws ! There is the people 
who fay to the robbers, 46 I will facrifice you all, if

it is our duty not to conceal the truth ; to whom 
we owe the truth naked, whole, and entire l 
Well, it is to that people' that I fay the Conven- 
tion is not free at Paris. The prefen t Conven- 
tion cannot fave you, another muft be called, 
it muft fit fomewhere elfe ; otherwile you will 
have neither conftitution nor government. 

What an happinefs it will be for me, if I arode-i,

too well ; I "am too well inftru&ed in what has, 
palled, to allow myfelf to he abufed by a few mo- 
ments of perfidious calm, by a few fittings, where-
